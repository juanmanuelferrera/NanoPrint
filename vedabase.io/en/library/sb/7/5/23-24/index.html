This is the symptom of pure devotional service. A pure devotee is interested only in devotional service, not in material affairs. To execute devotional service, one should always engage in hearing and chanting about Kṛṣṇa, or Lord Viṣṇu. The process of temple worship is called <em>arcana.</em> How to perform <em>arcana</em> will be explained herein. One should have complete faith in the words of Kṛṣṇa, who says that He is the great well-wishing friend of everyone (<em>suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānām</em>). A devotee considers Kṛṣṇa the only friend. This is called <em>sakhyam.</em> <em>Puṁsārpitā viṣṇau.</em> The word <em>puṁsā</em> means “by all living entities.” There are no distinctions permitting only a man or only a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> to offer devotional service to the Lord. Everyone can do so. As confirmed in <a href="/en/library/bg/9/32/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (9.32)</a>, <em>striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās te ’pi yānti parāṁ gatim:</em> although women, <em>vaiśyas</em> and <em>śūdras</em> are considered less intelligent, they also can become devotees and return home, back to Godhead.</div></div><div id="bb45354" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">After performing sacrifices, sometimes a person engaged in fruitive activity customarily offers the results to Viṣṇu. But here it is said, <em>bhagavaty addhā:</em> one must directly offer everything to Viṣṇu. This is called <em>sannyāsa</em> (not merely <em>nyāsa</em>). A <em>tridaṇḍi-sannyāsī</em> carries three <em>daṇḍas,</em> signifying <em>kaya-mano-vākya</em> — body, mind and words. All of these should be offered to Viṣṇu, and then one can begin devotional service. Fruitive workers first perform some pious activities and then formally or officially offer the results to Viṣṇu. The real devotee, however, first offers his surrender to Kṛṣṇa with his body, mind and words and then uses his body, mind and words for the service of Kṛṣṇa as Kṛṣṇa desires.</div></div><div id="bb45355" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura gives the following explanation in his <em>Tathya.</em> The word <em>śravaṇa</em> refers to giving aural reception to the holy name and descriptions of the Lord’s form, qualities, entourage and pastimes as explained in <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Bhagavad-gītā</em> and similar authorized scriptures. After aurally receiving such messages, one should memorize these vibrations and repeat them (<em>kīrtanam</em>). <em>Smaraṇam</em> means trying to understand more and more about the Supreme Lord, and <em>pāda-sevanam</em> means engaging oneself in serving the lotus feet of the Lord according to the time and circumstances. <em>Arcanam</em> means worshiping Lord Viṣṇu as one does in the temple, and <em>vandanam</em> means offering respectful obeisances. <em>Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru.</em> <em>Vandanam</em> means <em>namaskuru</em> — offering obeisances or offering prayers. Thinking oneself to be <em>nitya-kṛṣṇa-dāsa,</em> everlastingly a servant of Kṛṣṇa, is called <em>dāsyam,</em> and <em>sakhyam</em> means being a well-wisher of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa wants everyone to surrender unto Him because everyone is constitutionally His servant. Therefore, as a sincere friend of Kṛṣṇa, one should preach this philosophy, requesting everyone to surrender unto Kṛṣṇa. <em>Ātma-nivedanam</em> means offering Kṛṣṇa everything, including one’s body, mind, intelligence and whatever one may possess.</div></div><div id="bb45356" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">One’s sincere endeavor to perform these nine processes of devotional service is technically called <em>bhakti.</em> The word <em>addhā</em> means “directly.” One should not be like the <em>karmīs,</em> who perform pious activities and then formally offer the results to Kṛṣṇa.

This <em>Upaniṣad</em> describes that <em>bhakti</em> is the offering of devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. To perform devotional service, one should be relieved of the bodily conception of life and aspirations to be happy through elevation to the higher planetary systems. In other words, work performed simply for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, without any desire for material benefits, is called <em>bhakti.</em> <em>Bhakti</em> is also called <em>niṣkarma,</em> or freedom from the results of fruitive activity. <em>Bhakti</em> and <em>niṣkarma</em> are on the same platform, although devotional service and fruitive activity appear almost the same.</div></div><div id="bb45360" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The nine different processes enunciated by Prahlāda Mahārāja, who learned them from Nārada Muni, may not all be required for the execution of devotional service; if a devotee performs only one of these nine without deviation, he can attain the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sometimes it is found that when one performs one of the processes, other processes are mixed with it. That is not improper for a devotee. When a devotee executes any one of the nine processes (<em>nava-lakṣaṇā</em>), this is sufficient; the other eight processes are included. Now let us discuss these nine different processes.</div></div><div id="bb45361" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">(1) <em>Śravaṇam.</em> Hearing of the holy name of the Lord (<em>śravaṇam</em>) is the beginning of devotional service. Although any one of the nine processes is sufficient, in chronological order the hearing of the holy name of the Lord is the beginning. Indeed, it is essential. As enunciated by Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, <em>ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam:</em> by chanting the holy name of the Lord, one is cleansed of the material conception of life, which is due to the dirty modes of material nature. When the dirt is cleansed from the core of one’s heart, one can realize the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead — <em>īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ</em>. Thus by hearing the holy name of the Lord, one comes to the platform of understanding the personal form of the Lord. After realizing the Lord’s form, one can realize the transcendental qualities of the Lord, and when one can understand His transcendental qualities one can understand the Lord’s associates. In this way a devotee advances further and further toward complete understanding of the Lord as he awakens in realization of the Lord’s holy name, transcendental form and qualities, His paraphernalia, and everything pertaining to Him. Therefore the chronological process is <em>śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ.</em> This same process of chronological understanding holds true in chanting and remembering. When the chanting of the holy name, form, qualities and paraphernalia is heard from the mouth of a pure devotee, his hearing and chanting are very pleasing. Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī has forbidden us to hear the chanting of an artificial devotee or nondevotee.</div></div><div id="bb45362" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Hearing from the text of <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> is considered the most important process of hearing. <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> is full of transcendental chanting of the holy name, and therefore the chanting and hearing of <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> are transcendentally full of mellows. The transcendental holy name of the Lord may be heard and chanted accordingly to the attraction of the devotee. One may chant the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa, or one may chant the holy name of Lord Rāma or Nṛsiṁhadeva (<em>rāmādi-mūrtiṣu kalā-niyamena tiṣṭhan</em>). The Lord has innumerable forms and names, and devotees may meditate upon a particular form and chant the holy name according to his attraction. The best course is to hear of the holy name, form and so on from a pure devotee of the same standard as oneself. In other words, one who is attached to Kṛṣṇa should chant and hear from other pure devotees who are also attached to Lord Kṛṣṇa. The same principle applies for devotees attracted by Lord Rāma, Lord Nṛsiṁha and other forms of the Lord. Because Kṛṣṇa is the ultimate form of the Lord (<em>kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam</em>), it is best to hear about Lord Kṛṣṇa’s name, form and pastimes from a realized devotee who is particularly attracted by the form of Lord Kṛṣṇa. In <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</em> great devotees like Śukadeva Gosvāmī have specifically described Lord Kṛṣṇa’s holy name, form and qualities. Unless one hears about the holy name, form and qualities of the Lord, one cannot clearly understand the other processes of devotional service. Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu recommends that one chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa. <em>Paraṁ vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam.</em> If one is fortunate enough to hear from the mouth of realized devotees, he is very easily successful on the path of devotional service. Therefore hearing of the holy name, form and qualities of the Lord is essential.</div></div><div id="bb45363" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In <a href="/en/library/sb/1/5/11/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> (1.5.11)</a> there is this verse:</div></div><div id="bb45364" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic"><em>tad-vāg-visargo janatāgha-viplavo<br />yasmin prati-ślokam abaddhavaty api<br />nāmāny anantasya yaśo-’ṅkitāni yat<br />śṛṇvanti gāyanti gṛṇanti sādhavaḥ</em></div></div><div id="bb45365" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">“Verses describing the name, form and qualities of Anantadeva, the unlimited Supreme Lord, are able to vanquish all the sinful reactions of the entire world.

If there is no such opportunity, he alone chants and hears the Lord’s holy name.</div></div><div id="bb45366" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">(2) <em>Kīrtanam.</em> The hearing of the holy name has been described above. Now let us try to understand the chanting of the holy name, which is the second item in the consecutive order. It is recommended that such chanting be performed very loudly. In <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</em> Nārada Muni says that without shame he began traveling all over the world, chanting the holy name of the Lord. Similarly, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has advised:</div></div><div id="bb45367" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic"><em>tṛṇād api sunīcena<br />taror api sahiṣṇunā<br />amāninā mānadena<br />kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ</em></div></div><div id="bb45368" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">A devotee can very peacefully chant the holy name of the Lord by behaving more humbly than the grass, being tolerant like a tree and offering respects to everyone, without expecting honor from anyone else. Such qualifications make it easier to chant the holy name of the Lord. The process of transcendental chanting can be easily performed by anyone. Even if one is physically unfit, classified lower than others, devoid of material qualifications or not at all elevated in terms of pious activities, the chanting of the holy name is beneficial. An aristocratic birth, an advanced education, beautiful bodily features, wealth and similar results of pious activities are all unnecessary for advancement in spiritual life, for one can very easily advance simply by chanting the holy name. It is understood from the authoritative source of Vedic literature that especially in this age, Kali-yuga, people are generally short-living, extremely bad in their habits, and inclined to accept methods of devotional service that are not bona fide. Moreover, they are always disturbed by material conditions, and they are mostly unfortunate. Under the circumstances, the performance of other processes, such as <em>yajña, dāna, tapaḥ</em> and <em>kriyā</em> — sacrifices, charity and so on — are not at all possible. Therefore it is recommended:</div></div><div id="bb45369" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic"><em>harer nāma harer nāma<br />harer nāmaiva kevalam<br />kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva<br />nāsty eva gatir anyathā</em></div></div><div id="bb45370" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">“In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting of the holy name of the Lord.

This is the best process for success in life. In other ages, the chanting of the holy name is equally powerful, but especially in this age, Kali-yuga, it is most powerful. <em>Kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet:</em> simply by chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa, one is liberated and returns home, back to Godhead. Therefore, even if one is able to perform other processes of devotional service, one must adopt the chanting of the holy name as the principal method of advancing in spiritual life. <em>Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ:</em> those who are very sharp in their intelligence should adopt this process of chanting the holy names of the Lord. One should not, however, manufacture different types of chanting. One should adhere seriously to the chanting of the holy name as recommended in the scriptures: Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.</div></div><div id="bb45371" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">While chanting the holy name of the Lord, one should be careful to avoid ten offenses. From Sanat-kumāra it is understood that even if a person is a severe offender in many ways, he is freed from offensive life if he takes shelter of the Lord’s holy name. Indeed, even if a human being is no better than a two-legged animal, he will be liberated if he takes shelter of the holy name of the Lord. One should therefore be very careful not to commit offenses at the lotus feet of the Lord’s holy name. The offenses are described as follows: (<em>a</em>) to blaspheme a devotee, especially a devotee engaged in broadcasting the glories of the holy name, (<em>b</em>) to consider the name of Lord Śiva or any other demigod to be equally as powerful as the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (no one is equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, nor is anyone superior to Him), (<em>c</em>) to disobey the instructions of the spiritual master, (<em>d</em>) to blaspheme the Vedic literatures and literatures compiled in pursuance of the Vedic literatures, (<em>e</em>) to comment that the glories of the holy name of the Lord are exaggerated, (<em>f</em>) to interpret the holy name in a deviant way, (<em>g</em>) to commit sinful activities on the strength of chanting the holy name, (<em>h</em>) to compare the chanting of the holy name to pious activities, (<em>i</em>) to instruct the glories of the holy name to a person who has no understanding of the chanting of the holy name, (<em>j</em>) not to awaken in transcendental attachment for the chanting of the holy name, even after hearing all these scriptural injunctions.</div></div><div id="bb45372" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">There is no way to atone for any of these offenses. It is therefore recommended that an offender at the feet of the holy name continue to chant the holy name twenty-four hours a day. Constant chanting of the holy name will make one free of offenses, and then he will gradually be elevated to the transcendental platform on which he can chant the pure holy name and thus become a lover of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div></div><div id="bb45373" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">It is recommended that even if one commits offenses, one should continue chanting the holy name.

In this connection there is the following statement, spoken by Dakṣa to Lord Śiva: “I did not know the glories of your personality, and therefore I committed an offense at your lotus feet in the open assembly. You are so kind, however, that you did not accept my offense. Instead, when I was falling down because of accusing you, you saved me by your merciful glance. You are most great.

These are as follows: (<em>a</em>) conducting research into the worship of a particular form of the Lord, (<em>b</em>) concentrating the mind on one subject and withdrawing the mind’s activities of thinking, feeling and willing from all other subjects, (<em>c</em>) concentrating upon a particular form of the Lord (this is called meditation), (<em>d</em>) concentrating one’s mind continuously on the form of the Lord (this is called <em>dhruvānusmṛti,</em> or perfect meditation), and (<em>e</em>) awakening a likening for concentration upon a particular form (this is called <em>samādhi,</em> or trance). Mental concentration upon particular pastimes of the Lord in particular circumstances is also called remembrance.

Bathing in the Ganges and serving a pure Vaiṣṇava are also known as <em>tadīya-upāsanam.</em> This is also <em>pāda-sevanam.</em> The word <em>tadīya</em> means “in relationship with the Lord.” Service to the Vaiṣṇava, Tulasī, Ganges and Yamunā are included in <em>pāda-sevanam.</em> All these processes of <em>pāda-sevanam</em> help one advance in spiritual life very quickly.</div></div><div id="bb45379" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">(5) <em>Arcanam.</em> After <em>pāda-sevanam</em> comes the process of <em>arcanam,</em> worship of the Deity. If one is interested in the process of <em>arcanam,</em> one must positively take shelter of a bona fide spiritual master and learn the process from him. There are many books for <em>arcana,</em> especially <em>Nārada-pañcarātra.</em> In this age, the <em>Pañcarātra</em> system is particularly recommended for <em>arcana,</em> Deity worship. There are two systems of <em>arcana</em> — the <em>bhāgavata</em> system and <em>pāñcarātrikī</em> system. In the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> there is no recommendation of <em>pāñcarātrikī</em> worship because in this Kali-yuga, even without Deity worship, everything can be perfectly performed simply through hearing, chanting, remembering and worship of the lotus feet of the Lord. Rūpa Gosvāmī states:</div></div><div id="bb45380" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic"><em>śrī-viṣṇoḥ śravaṇe parīkṣid abhavad vaiyāsakiḥ kīrtane<br />prahlādaḥ smaraṇe tad-aṅghri-bhajane lakṣmīḥ pṛthuḥ pūjane<br />akrūras tv abhivandane kapi-patir dāsye ’tha sakhye ’rjunaḥ<br />sarvasvātma-nivedane balir abhūt kṛṣṇāptir eṣāṁ param</em></div></div><div id="bb45381" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">“Parīkṣit Mahārāja attained salvation simply by hearing, and Śukadeva Gosvāmī attained salvation simply by chanting.

Pṛthu Mahārāja attained salvation by worshiping the Deity of the Lord. Akrūra attained salvation by offering prayers, Hanumān by rendering service, Arjuna by establishing friendship with the Lord, and Bali Mahārāja by offering everything to the service of the Lord.” All these great devotees served the Lord according to a particular process, but every one of them attained salvation and became eligible to return home, back to Godhead. This is explained in <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</em></div></div><div id="bb45382" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">It is therefore recommended that initiated devotees follow the principles of <em>Nārada-pañcarātra</em> by worshiping the Deity in the temple. Especially for householder devotees who are opulent in material possessions, the path of Deity worship is strongly recommended. An opulent householder devotee who does not engage his hard-earned money in the service of the Lord is called a miser. One should not engage paid <em>brāhmaṇas</em> to worship the Deity. If one does not personally worship the Deity but engages paid servants instead, he is considered lazy, and his worship of the Deity is called artificial. An opulent householder can collect luxurious paraphernalia for Deity worship, and consequently for householder devotees the worship of the Deity is compulsory. In our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement there are <em>brahmacārīs, gṛhasthas, vānaprasthas</em> and <em>sannyāsīs,</em> but the Deity worship in the temple should be performed especially by the householders. The <em>brahmacārīs</em> can go with the <em>sannyāsīs</em> to preach, and the <em>vānaprasthas</em> should prepare themselves for the next status of renounced life, <em>sannyāsa.</em> <em>Gṛhastha</em> devotees, however, are generally engaged in material activities, and therefore if they do not take to Deity worship, their falling down is positively assured. Deity worship means following the rules and regulations precisely. That will keep one steady in devotional service. Generally householders have children, and then the wives of the householders should be engaged in caring for the children, just as women acting as teachers care for the children in a nursery school.</div></div><div id="bb45383" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><em>Gṛhastha</em> devotees must adopt the <em>arcana-vidhi,</em> or Deity worship according to the suitable arrangements and directions given by the spiritual master. Regarding those unable to take to the Deity worship in the temple, there is the following statement in the <em>Agni Purāṇa.</em> Any householder devotee circumstantially unable to worship the Deity must at least see the Deity worship, and in this way he may achieve success also. The special purpose of Deity worship is to keep oneself always pure and clean. <em>Gṛhastha</em> devotees should be actual examples of cleanliness.</div></div><div id="bb45384" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Deity worship should be continued along with hearing and chanting. Therefore every <em>mantra</em> is preceded by the word <em>namaḥ.</em> In all the <em>mantras</em> there are specific potencies, of which the <em>gṛhastha</em> devotees must take advantage. There are many <em>mantras</em> preceded by the word <em>namaḥ,</em> but if one chants the holy name of the Lord, he receives the result of chanting <em>namaḥ</em> many times. By chanting the holy name of the Lord, one can reach the platform of love of Godhead. One might ask, then what is the necessity of being initiated? The answer is that even though the chanting of the holy name is sufficient to enable one to progress in spiritual life to the standard of love of Godhead, one is nonetheless susceptible to contamination because of possessing a material body. Consequently, special stress is given to the <em>arcana-vidhi.</em> One should therefore regularly take advantage of both the <em>bhāgavata</em> process and <em>pāñcarātrikī</em> process.</div></div><div id="bb45385" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Deity worship has two divisions, namely pure and mixed with fruitive activities. For one who is steady, Deity worship is compulsory. Observing the various types of festivals, such as Śrī Janmāṣṭamī, Rāma-navamī and Nṛsiṁha-caturdaśī, is also included in the process of Deity worship. In other words, it is compulsory for householder devotees to observe these festivals.</div></div><div id="bb45386" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now let us discuss the offenses in Deity worship. The following are offenses: (<em>a</em>) to enter the temple with shoes or being carried on a palanquin, (<em>b</em>) not to observe the prescribed festivals, (<em>c</em>) to avoid offering obeisances in front of the Deity, (<em>d</em>) to offer prayers in an unclean state, not having washed one’s hands after eating, (<em>e</em>) to offer obeisances with one hand, (<em>f</em>) to circumambulate directly in front of the Deity, (<em>g</em>) to spread one’s legs before the Deity, (<em>h</em>) to sit before the Deity while holding one’s ankles with one’s hands, (<em>i</em>) to lie down before the Deity, (<em>j</em>) to eat before the Deity, (<em>k</em>) to speak lies before the Deity, (<em>l</em>) to address someone loudly before the Deity, (<em>m</em>) to talk nonsense before the Deity, (<em>n</em>) to cry before the Deity, (<em>o</em>) to argue before the Deity, (<em>p</em>) to chastise someone before the Deity, (<em>q</em>) to show someone favor before the Deity, (<em>r</em>) to use harsh words before the Deity, (<em>s</em>) to wear a woolen blanket before the Deity, (<em>t</em>) to blaspheme someone before the Deity, (<em>u</em>) to worship someone else before the Deity, (<em>v</em>) to use vulgar language before the Deity, (<em>w</em>) to pass air before the Deity, (<em>x</em>) to avoid very opulent worship of the Deity, even though one is able to perform it, (<em>y</em>) to eat something not offered to the Deity, (<em>z</em>) to avoid offering fresh fruits to the Deity according to the season, (<em>aa</em>) to offer food to the Deity which has already been used or from which has first been given to others (in other words, food should not be distributed to anyone else until it has been offered to the Deity), (<em>bb</em>) to sit with one’s back toward the Deity, (<em>cc</em>) to offer obeisances to someone else in front of the Deity, (<em>dd</em>) not to chant proper prayers when offering obeisances to the spiritual master, (<em>ee</em>) to praise oneself before the Deity, and (<em>ff</em>) to blaspheme the demigods. In the worship of the Deity, these thirty-two offenses should be avoided.</div></div><div id="bb45387" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <em>Varāha Purāṇa</em> the following offenses are mentioned: (<em>a</em>) to eat in the house of a rich man, (<em>b</em>) to enter the Deity’s room in the dark, (<em>c</em>) to worship the Deity without following the regulative principles, (<em>d</em>) to enter the temple without vibrating any sound, (<em>e</em>) to collect food that has been seen by a dog, (<em>f</em>) to break silence while offering worship to the Deity, (<em>g</em>) to go to the toilet during the time of worshiping the Deity, (<em>h</em>) to offer incense without offering flowers, (<em>i</em>) to worship the Deity with forbidden flowers, (<em>j</em>) to begin worship without having washed one’s teeth, (<em>k</em>) to begin worship after sex, (<em>l</em>) to touch a lamp, dead body or a woman during her menstrual period, or to put on red or bluish clothing, unwashed clothing, the clothing of others or soiled clothing. Other offenses are to worship the Deity after seeing a dead body, to pass air before the Deity, to show anger before the Deity, and to worship the Deity just after returning from a crematorium. After eating, one should not worship the Deity until one has digested his food, nor should one touch the Deity or engage in any Deity worship after eating safflower oil or hing. These are also offenses.</div></div><div id="bb45388" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In other places, the following offenses are listed: (<em>a</em>) to be against the scriptural injunctions of the Vedic literature or to disrespect within one’s heart the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> while externally falsely accepting its principles, (<em>b</em>) to introduce differing <em>śāstras,</em> (<em>c</em>) to chew pan and betel before the Deity, (<em>d</em>) to keep flowers for worship on the leaf of a castor oil plant, (<em>e</em>) to worship the Deity in the afternoon, (<em>f</em>) to sit on the altar or to sit on the floor to worship the Deity (without a seat), (<em>g</em>) to touch the Deity with the left hand while bathing the Deity, (<em>h</em>) to worship the Deity with a stale or used flower, (<em>i</em>) to spit while worshiping the Deity, (<em>j</em>) to advertise one’s glory while worshiping the Deity, (<em>k</em>) to apply <em>tilaka</em> to one’s forehead in a curved way, (<em>l</em>) to enter the temple without having washed one’s feet, (<em>m</em>) to offer the Deity food cooked by an uninitiated person, (<em>n</em>) to worship the Deity and offer <em>bhoga</em> to the Deity within the vision of an uninitiated person or non-Vaiṣṇava, (<em>o</em>) to offer worship to the Deity without worshiping Vaikuṇṭha deities like Gaṇeśa, (<em>p</em>) to worship the Deity while perspiring, (<em>q</em>) to refuse flowers offered to the Deity, (<em>r</em>) to take a vow or oath in the holy name of the Lord.</div></div><div id="bb45389" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">If one commits any of the above offenses, one must read at least one chapter of <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> This is confirmed in the <em>Skanda-Purāṇa, Avantī-khaṇḍa.</em> Similarly, there is another injunction, stating that one who reads the thousand names of Viṣṇu can be released from all offenses. In the same <em>Skanda-Purāṇa, Revā-khaṇḍa,</em> it is said that one who recites prayers to <em>tulasī</em> or sows a <em>tulasī</em> seed is also freed from all offenses. Similarly, one who worships the <em>śālagrāma-śilā</em> can also be relieved of offenses. In the <em>Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa</em> it is said that one who worships Lord Viṣṇu, whose four hands bear a conchshell, disc, lotus flower and club, can be relieved from the above offenses. In the <em>Ādi-varāha Purāṇa</em> it is said that a worshiper who has committed offenses may fast for one day at the holy place known as Śaukarava and then bathe in the Ganges.</div></div><div id="bb45390" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the process of worshiping the Deity it is sometimes enjoined that one worship the Deity within the mind. In the <em>Padma Purāṇa, Uttara-khaṇḍa,</em> it is said, “All persons can generally worship within the mind.” The <em>Gautamīya Tantra</em> states, “For a <em>sannyāsī</em> who has no home, worship of the Deity within the mind is recommended.” In the <em>Nārada-pañcarātra</em> it is stated by Lord Nārāyaṇa that worship of the Deity within the mind is called <em>mānasa-pūjā.</em> One can become free from the four miseries by this method. Sometimes worship from the mind can be independently executed. According to the instruction of Āvirhotra Muni, one of the <em>nava-yogendras,</em> as mentioned in <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</em> one may worship the Deity by chanting all the <em>mantras.</em> Eight kinds of Deities are mentioned in the <em>śāstra,</em> and the mental Deity is one of them. In this regard, the following description is given in the <em>Brahma-vaivarta Purāṇa.</em></div></div><div id="bb45391" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the city of Pratiṣṭhāna-pura, long ago, there resided a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> who was poverty-stricken but innocent and not dissatisfied. One day he heard a discourse in an assembly of <em>brāhmaṇas</em> concerning how to worship the Deity in the temple. In that meeting, he also heard that the Deity may be worshiped within the mind. After this incident, the <em>brāhmaṇa,</em> having bathed in the Godāvarī River, began mentally worshiping the Deity. He would wash the temple within his mind, and then in his imagination he would bring water from all the sacred rivers in golden and silver waterpots. He collected all kinds of valuable paraphernalia for worship, and he worshiped the Deity very gorgeously, beginning from bathing the Deity and ending with offering <em>ārati.</em> Thus he felt great happiness. After many years had passed in this way, one day within his mind he cooked nice sweet rice with ghee to worship the Deity. He placed the sweet rice on a golden dish and offered it to Lord Kṛṣṇa, but he felt that the sweet rice was very hot, and therefore he touched it with his finger. He immediately felt that his finger had been burned by the hot sweet rice, and thus he began to lament. While the <em>brāhmaṇa</em> was in pain, Lord Viṣṇu in Vaikuṇṭha began smiling, and the goddess of fortune inquired from the Lord why He was smiling. Lord Viṣṇu then ordered His associates to bring the <em>brāhmaṇa</em> to Vaikuṇṭha. Thus the <em>brāhmaṇa</em> attained the liberation of <em>sāmīpya,</em> the facility of living near the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div></div><div id="bb45392" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">(6) <em>Vandanam.</em> Although prayers are a part of Deity worship, they may be considered separately like the other items, such as hearing and chanting, and therefore separate statements are given herewith. The Lord has unlimited transcendental qualities and opulences, and one who feels influenced by the Lord’s qualities in various activities offers prayers to the Lord. In this way he becomes successful. In this connection, the following are some of the offenses to be avoided: (<em>a</em>) to offer obeisances on one hand, (<em>b</em>) to offer obeisances with one’s body covered, (<em>c</em>) to show one’s back to the Deity, (<em>d</em>) to offer obeisances on the left side of the Deity, (<em>e</em>) to offer obeisances very near the Deity.</div></div><div id="bb45393" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">(7) <em>Dāsyam.</em> There is the following statement in regard to assisting the Lord as a servant. After many, many thousands of births, when one comes to understand that he is an eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa, one can deliver others from this universe. If one simply continues to think that he is an eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa, even without performing any other process of devotional service, he can attain full success, for simply by this feeling one can perform all nine processes of devotional service.</div></div><div id="bb45394" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">(8) <em>Sakhyam.</em> In regard to worshiping the Lord as a friend, the <em>Agastya-saṁhitā</em> states that a devotee engaged in performing devotional service by <em>śravaṇam</em> and <em>kīrtanam</em> sometimes wants to see the Lord personally, and for this purpose he resides in the temple. Elsewhere there is this statement: “O my Lord, Supreme Personality and eternal friend, although You are full of bliss and knowledge, You have become the friend of the residents of Vṛndāvana. How fortunate are these devotees!” In this statement the word “friend” is specifically used to indicate intense love. Friendship, therefore, is better than servitude. In the stage above <em>dāsya-rasa,</em> the devotee accepts the Supreme Personality of Godhead as a friend. This is not at all astonishing, for when a devotee is pure in heart the opulence of his worship of the Deity diminishes as spontaneous love for the Personality of Godhead is manifested. In this regard, Śrīdhara Svāmī mentions Śrīdāma Vipra, who expressed to himself his feelings of obligation, thinking, “Life after life, may I be connected with Kṛṣṇa in this friendly attitude.”</div></div><div id="bb45395" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">(9) <em>Ātma-nivedanam.</em> The word <em>ātma-nivedanam</em> refers to the stage at which one who has no motive other than to serve the Lord surrenders everything to the Lord and performs his activities only to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a devotee is like a cow that is cared for by its master. When cared for by its master, a cow is not in anxiety over its maintenance. Such a cow is always devoted to its master, and it never acts independently, but only for the master’s benefit. Some devotees, therefore, consider dedication of the body to the Lord to be <em>ātma-nivedanam,</em> and as stated in the book known as <em>Bhakti-viveka,</em> sometimes dedication of the soul to the Lord is called <em>ātma-nivedanam.</em> The best examples of <em>ātma-nivedanam</em> are found in Bali Mahārāja and Ambarīṣa Mahārāja. <em>Ātma-nivedanam</em> is also sometimes found in the behavior of Rukmiṇīdevī at Dvārakā.</div></div></div></div><div class="mt-10 flex justify-between"><a href="/en/library/sb/7/5/22/" class="inline-flex font-sans items-center px-4 py-2 mr-4 text-base font-medium bg-vb-header-top bg-opacity-30 border border-vb-header-top border-opacity-30 rounded-lg hover:bg-opacity-50"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 448 512" class="mr-2" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M257.5 445.1l-22.2 22.2c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0L7 273c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9L201.4 44.7c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0l22.2 22.2c9.5 9.5 9.3 25-.4 34.3L136.6 216H424c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24v32c0 13.3-10.7 24-24 24H136.6l120.5 114.8c9.8 9.3 10 24.8.4 34.3z"></path></svg>Text 22</a><a href="/en/library/sb/7/5/25/" class="inline-flex font-sans items-center px-4 py-2 text-base font-medium bg-vb-header-top bg-opacity-30 border border-vb-header-top border-opacity-30 rounded-lg hover:bg-opacity-50">Text 25<svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 448 512" class="ml-2" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M190.5 66.9l22.2-22.2c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0L441 239c9.4 9.4 9.4 24.6 0 33.9L246.6 467.3c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0l-22.2-22.2c-9.5-9.5-9.3-25 .4-34.3L311.4 296H24c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24v-32c0-13.3 10.7-24 24-24h287.4L190.9 101.2c-9.8-9.3-10-24.8-.4-34.3z"></path></svg></a></div></main></div><div id="footer" class="mt-auto pt-3 mb-6 text-sm text-vb-normal-text/80 text-center"><div class="px-4 py-4 w-full max-w-screen-xl mx-auto md:px-8 text-sm text-vb-normal-text/80"><div class="py-2 px-3 border border-dashed border-vb-normal-text/15 text-justify relative "><a href="/en/donate/" class="z-20 float-right my-2 ml-3 w-auto border border-vb-action-border bg-vb-action-bg hover:bg-vb-action-bg/80 rounded-md text-vb-action-text py-3 px-6 text-center disabled:opacity-50">Donate</a><span class="flex-grow">Thanks to <span>Vinod Bapat and Meenal Bapat; Mahavisnupriya dasi &amp; Gostavihari das;   Kuldip Persaud; Gagan Kangovi; Rajendra and Geeta Ramchandani; NIOS - North American Institute for Oriental and Classical Studies; Jaykumar Prabhakar; Anantha SriSimha das, Spore; Bharat Vyas; HG Lakshmipati Narayan Das; HG Ragatmika Gopika Devi Dasi; Shri Chander Mohan Gilhotra; HG Prashant Mukund Das; Shri Trilok Singh Grover; Aneesh Koppula; Ronak Talati; Bhargav Ashok; J.K Ahuja; Akiralali; Radhapati Das; Bimal Gupta; Rajasa das; Aishwarya Balaraj; Yogendra Sharad Puranik; Riya and Tejal Chopade; Devarajula Pradeep Kumar (Saroornagar, Hyderabad); Late Chetana Dilip Bhatt; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/indradyumna-swami">Indradyumna Swami</a>; Sachin; Geetanjali Nath; Mario; Joeie; Susheela and Rama Krishna Reddy Patlolla; Jai Devaki Parks; Ashmi Chakraborty; Hari-kirtana das; Ramesta das; Prasad Buddhavarapu; dasa; Kresna Sucandra; Late Mr. S.

Thus by hearing the holy name of the Lord, one comes to the platform of understanding the personal form of the Lord. After realizing the Lord’s form, one can realize the transcendental qualities of the Lord, and when one can understand His transcendental qualities one can understand the Lord’s associates. In this way a devotee advances further and further toward complete understanding of the Lord as he awakens in realization of the Lord’s holy name, transcendental form and qualities, His paraphernalia, and everything pertaining to Him. Therefore the chronological process is \u003cem\u003eśravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ.\u003c/em\u003e This same process of chronological understanding holds true in chanting and remembering.

Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī has forbidden us to hear the chanting of an artificial devotee or nondevotee.30:T7df,Hearing from the text of \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e is considered the most important process of hearing. \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e is full of transcendental chanting of the holy name, and therefore the chanting and hearing of \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e are transcendentally full of mellows. The transcendental holy name of the Lord may be heard and chanted accordingly to the attraction of the devotee. One may chant the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa, or one may chant the holy name of Lord Rāma or Nṛsiṁhadeva (\u003cem\u003erāmādi-mūrtiṣu kalā-niyamena tiṣṭhan\u003c/em\u003e). The Lord has innumerable forms and names, and devotees may meditate upon a particular form and chant the holy name according to his attraction. The best course is to hear of the holy name, form and so on from a pure devotee of the same standard as oneself. In other words, one who is attached to Kṛṣṇa should chant and hear from other pure devotees who are also attached to Lord Kṛṣṇa. The same principle applies for devotees attracted by Lord Rāma, Lord Nṛsiṁha and other forms of the Lord. Because Kṛṣṇa is the ultimate form of the Lord (\u003cem\u003ekṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam\u003c/em\u003e), it is best to hear about Lord Kṛṣṇa’s name, form and pastimes from a realized devotee who is particularly attracted by the form of Lord Kṛṣṇa. In \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,\u003c/em\u003e great devotees like Śukadeva Gosvāmī have specifically described Lord Kṛṣṇa’s holy name, form and qualities. Unless one hears about the holy name, form and qualities of the Lord, one cannot clearly understand the other processes of devotional service. Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu recommends that one chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa. \u003cem\u003eParaṁ vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam.\u003c/em\u003e If one is fo"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"rtunate enough to hear from the mouth of realized devotees, he is very easily successful on the path of devotional service. Therefore hearing of the holy name, form and qualities of the Lord is essential.31:T53e,A devotee can very peacefully chant the holy name of the Lord by behaving more humbly than the grass, being tolerant like a tree and offering respects to everyone, without expecting honor from anyone else. Such qualifications make it easier to chant the holy name of the Lord. The process of transcendental chanting can be easily performed by anyone. Even if one is physically unfit, classified lower than others, devoid of material qualifications or not at all elevated in terms of pious activities, the chanting of the holy name is beneficial. An aristocratic birth, an advanced education, beautiful bodily features, wealth and similar results of pious activities are all unnecessary for advancement in spiritual life, for one can very easily advance simply by chanting the holy name. It is understood from the authoritative source of Vedic literature that especially in this age, Kali-yuga, people are generally short-living, extremely bad in their habits, and inclined to accept methods of devotional service that are not bona fide. Moreover, they are always disturbed by material conditions, and they are mostly unfortunate. Under the circumstances, the performance of other processes, such as \u003cem\u003eyajña, dāna, tapaḥ\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003ekriyā\u003c/em\u003e — sacrifices, charity and so on — are not at all possible. Therefore it is recommended:32:T4ec,“In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting of the holy name of the Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way.” Simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord, one advances perfectly in spiritual life. This is the best process for success in life. In other ages, the chanting of the holy name is equally powerful, but especially in this age, Kali-yuga, it is most powerful. \u003cem\u003eKīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-sa"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"ṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet:\u003c/em\u003e simply by chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa, one is liberated and returns home, back to Godhead.

From Sanat-kumāra it is understood that even if a person is a severe offender in many ways, he is freed from offensive life if he takes shelter of the Lord’s holy name. Indeed, even if a human being is no better than a two-legged animal, he will be liberated if he takes shelter of the holy name of the Lord. One should therefore be very careful not to commit offenses at the lotus feet of the Lord’s holy name. The offenses are described as follows: (\u003cem\u003ea\u003c/em\u003e) to blaspheme a devotee, especially a devotee engaged in broadcasting the glories of the holy name, (\u003cem\u003eb\u003c/em\u003e) to consider the name of Lord Śiva or any other demigod to be equally as powerful as the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (no one is equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, nor is anyone superior to Him), (\u003cem\u003ec\u003c/em\u003e) to disobey the instructions of the spiritual master, (\u003cem\u003ed\u003c/em\u003e) to blaspheme the Vedic literatures and literatures compiled in pursuance of the Vedic literatures, (\u003cem\u003ee\u003c/em\u003e) to comment that the glories of the holy name of the Lord are exaggerated, (\u003cem\u003ef\u003c/em\u003e) to interpret the holy name in a deviant way, (\u003cem\u003eg\u003c/em\u003e) to commit sinful activities on the st"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"rength of chanting the holy name, (\u003cem\u003eh\u003c/em\u003e) to compare the chanting of the holy name to pious activities, (\u003cem\u003ei\u003c/em\u003e) to instruct the glories of the holy name to a person who has no understanding of the chanting of the holy name, (\u003cem\u003ej\u003c/em\u003e) not to awaken in transcendental attachment for the chanting of the holy name, even after hearing all these scriptural injunctions.34:T5b7,“O King, for great \u003cem\u003eyogīs\u003c/em\u003e who have completely renounced all material connections, for those who desire all material enjoyment and for those who are self-satisfied by dint of transcendental knowledge, constant chanting of the holy name of the Lord is recommended.” According to different relationships with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there are varieties of \u003cem\u003enāmānukīrtanam,\u003c/em\u003e chanting of the holy name, and thus according to different relationships and mellows there are five kinds of remembering. These are as follows: (\u003cem\u003ea\u003c/em\u003e) conducting research into the worship of a particular form of the Lord, (\u003cem\u003eb\u003c/em\u003e) concentrating the mind on one subject and withdrawing the mind’s activities of thinking, feeling and willing from all other subjects, (\u003cem\u003ec\u003c/em\u003e) concentrating upon a particular form of the Lord (this is called meditation), (\u003cem\u003ed\u003c/em\u003e) concentrating one’s mind continuously on the form of the Lord (this is called \u003cem\u003edhruvānusmṛti,\u003c/em\u003e or perfect meditation), and (\u003cem\u003ee\u003c/em\u003e) awakening a likening for concentration upon a particular form (this is called \u003cem\u003esamādhi,\u003c/em\u003e or trance). Mental concentration upon particular pastimes of the Lord in particular circumstances is also called remembrance.

Although any one of the nine processes is sufficient, in chronological order the hearing of the holy name of the Lord is the beginning. Indeed, it is essential. As enunciated by Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, \u003cem\u003eceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam:\u003c/em\u003e by chanting the holy name of the Lord, one is cleansed of the material conception of life, which is due to the dirty modes of material nature.

Thus by hearing the holy name of the Lord, one comes to the platform of understanding the personal form of the Lord. After realizing the Lord’s form, one can realize the transcendental qualities of the Lord, and when one can understand His transcendental qualities one can understand the Lord’s associates. In this way a devotee advances further and further toward complete understanding of the Lord as he awakens in realization of the Lord’s holy name, transcendental form and qualities, His paraphernalia, and everything pertaining to Him. Therefore the chronological process is \u003cem\u003eśravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ.\u003c/em"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\u003e This same process of chronological understanding holds true in chanting and remembering. When the chanting of the holy name, form, qualities and paraphernalia is heard from the mouth of a pure devotee, his hearing and chanting are very pleasing. Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī has forbidden us to hear the chanting of an artificial devotee or nondevotee.48:T7df,Hearing from the text of \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e is considered the most important process of hearing. \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e is full of transcendental chanting of the holy name, and therefore the chanting and hearing of \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e are transcendentally full of mellows. The transcendental holy name of the Lord may be heard and chanted accordingly to the attraction of the devotee. One may chant the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa, or one may chant the holy name of Lord Rāma or Nṛsiṁhadeva (\u003cem\u003erāmādi-mūrtiṣu kalā-niyamena tiṣṭhan\u003c/em\u003e). The Lord has innumerable forms and names, and devotees may meditate upon a particular form and chant the holy name according to his attraction. The best course is to hear of the holy name, form and so on from a pure devotee of the same standard as oneself. In other words, one who is attached to Kṛṣṇa should chant and hear from other pure devotees who are also attached to Lord Kṛṣṇa. The same principle applies for devotees attracted by Lord Rāma, Lord Nṛsiṁha and other forms of the Lord. Because Kṛṣṇa is the ultimate form of the Lord (\u003cem\u003ekṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam\u003c/em\u003e), it is best to hear about Lord Kṛṣṇa’s name, form and pastimes from a realized devotee who is particularly attracted by the form of Lord Kṛṣṇa. In \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,\u003c/em\u003e great devotees like Śukadeva Gosvāmī have specifically described Lord Kṛṣṇa’s holy name, form and qualities. Unless one hears about the holy name, form and qualities of the Lord, one cannot clearly understand the other processes of devotional service. Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu reco"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"mmends that one chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa. \u003cem\u003eParaṁ vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam.\u003c/em\u003e If one is fortunate enough to hear from the mouth of realized devotees, he is very easily successful on the path of devotional service. Therefore hearing of the holy name, form and qualities of the Lord is essential.49:T53e,A devotee can very peacefully chant the holy name of the Lord by behaving more humbly than the grass, being tolerant like a tree and offering respects to everyone, without expecting honor from anyone else. Such qualifications make it easier to chant the holy name of the Lord. The process of transcendental chanting can be easily performed by anyone. Even if one is physically unfit, classified lower than others, devoid of material qualifications or not at all elevated in terms of pious activities, the chanting of the holy name is beneficial. An aristocratic birth, an advanced education, beautiful bodily features, wealth and similar results of pious activities are all unnecessary for advancement in spiritual life, for one can very easily advance simply by chanting the holy name. It is understood from the authoritative source of Vedic literature that especially in this age, Kali-yuga, people are generally short-living, extremely bad in their habits, and inclined to accept methods of devotional service that are not bona fide. Moreover, they are always disturbed by material conditions, and they are mostly unfortunate. Under the circumstances, the performance of other processes, such as \u003cem\u003eyajña, dāna, tapaḥ\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003ekriyā\u003c/em\u003e — sacrifices, charity and so on — are not at all possible. Therefore it is recommended:4a:T4ec,“In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting of the holy name of the Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way.” Simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord, one advances perfectly in spiritual life. This is the best process for success in life.

Therefore, even if one is able to perform other processes of devotional service, one must adopt the chanting of the holy name as the principal method of advancing in spiritual life. \u003cem\u003eYajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ:\u003c/em\u003e those who are very sharp in their intelligence should adopt this process of chanting the holy names of the Lord. One should not, however, manufacture different types of chanting. One should adhere seriously to the chanting of the holy name as recommended in the scriptures: Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.4b:T66b,While chanting the holy name of the Lord, one should be careful to avoid ten offenses. From Sanat-kumāra it is understood that even if a person is a severe offender in many ways, he is freed from offensive life if he takes shelter of the Lord’s holy name. Indeed, even if a human being is no better than a two-legged animal, he will be liberated if he takes shelter of the holy name of the Lord. One should therefore be very careful not to commit offenses at the lotus feet of the Lord’s holy name. The offenses are described as follows: (\u003cem\u003ea\u003c/em\u003e) to blaspheme a devotee, especially a devotee engaged in broadcasting the glories of the holy name, (\u003cem\u003eb\u003c/em\u003e) to consider the name of Lord Śiva or any other demigod to be equally as powerful as the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (no one is equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, nor is anyone superior to Him), (\u003cem\u003ec\u003c/em\u003e) to disobey the instructions of the spiritual master, (\u003cem\u003ed\u003c/em\u003e) to blaspheme the Vedic literatures and literatures compiled in pursuance of the Vedic literatures, (\u003cem\u003ee\u003c/em\u003e) to comment that the glories of the holy name of the Lord a"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"re exaggerated, (\u003cem\u003ef\u003c/em\u003e) to interpret the holy name in a deviant way, (\u003cem\u003eg\u003c/em\u003e) to commit sinful activities on the strength of chanting the holy name, (\u003cem\u003eh\u003c/em\u003e) to compare the chanting of the holy name to pious activities, (\u003cem\u003ei\u003c/em\u003e) to instruct the glories of the holy name to a person who has no understanding of the chanting of the holy name, (\u003cem\u003ej\u003c/em\u003e) not to awaken in transcendental attachment for the chanting of the holy name, even after hearing all these scriptural injunctions.4c:T5b7,“O King, for great \u003cem\u003eyogīs\u003c/em\u003e who have completely renounced all material connections, for those who desire all material enjoyment and for those who are self-satisfied by dint of transcendental knowledge, constant chanting of the holy name of the Lord is recommended.” According to different relationships with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there are varieties of \u003cem\u003enāmānukīrtanam,\u003c/em\u003e chanting of the holy name, and thus according to different relationships and mellows there are five kinds of remembering. These are as follows: (\u003cem\u003ea\u003c/em\u003e) conducting research into the worship of a particular form of the Lord, (\u003cem\u003eb\u003c/em\u003e) concentrating the mind on one subject and withdrawing the mind’s activities of thinking, feeling and willing from all other subjects, (\u003cem\u003ec\u003c/em\u003e) concentrating upon a particular form of the Lord (this is called meditation), (\u003cem\u003ed\u003c/em\u003e) concentrating one’s mind continuously on the form of the Lord (this is called \u003cem\u003edhruvānusmṛti,\u003c/em\u003e or perfect meditation), and (\u003cem\u003ee\u003c/em\u003e) awakening a likening for concentration upon a particular form (this is called \u003cem\u003esamādhi,\u003c/em\u003e or trance). Mental concentration upon particular pastimes of the Lord in particular circumstances is also called remembrance. Therefore \u003cem\u003esamādhi,\u003c/em\u003e trance, can be possible in five different ways in terms of one’s relationship.
