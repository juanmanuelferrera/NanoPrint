em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">This material world is certified by its very creator, the Supreme Lord, as <em>duḥkhālayam,</em> which means “the place of miseries.” Since this is the case, how can we possibly make it comfortable by so-called scientific advancement? <em>Duḥkha</em> means “misery” or “suffering,” and real suffering is birth, old age, disease, and death. We have set these problems aside because we cannot solve them; therefore scientists concentrate on atomic bombs and spaceships. Why can’t they solve these important problems that are always causing us to suffer? Obviously, they haven’t the power to do so.</div></div><div id="bb95827" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">But in this verse, Śrī Kṛṣṇa gives the solution: <em>mām upetya punar janma nāpnuvanti.</em> That is, “If one attains My platform, he does not come back again to this place of misery.” Unfortunately, in the mode of ignorance, people cannot understand that they are in a miserable situation. Animals cannot understand their miserable situations because they haven’t the reason. Man possesses reason whereby he can understand this, but in this age people are using their reasoning power in order to gratify their animal propensities. Reason should be used in getting liberated from this miserable condition. However, if we engage in Kṛṣṇa consciousness twenty-four hours a day without deviation, we will go to Kṛṣṇa and not be reborn in this miserable world. <em>Mahātmānaḥ saṁsiddhiṁ paramāṁ gatāḥ:</em> those great souls who have attained the highest perfection, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, are forever freed from misery. In this verse, the word <em>mahātmā</em> refers to a Kṛṣṇa conscious man eligible to enter the abode of Kṛṣṇa. The word <em>mahātmā</em> does not refer to a political leader like Mahatma Gandhi but to a great soul, a pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa.</div></div><div id="bb95828" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">When Kṛṣṇa says that the <em>mahātmā</em> enters His abode, He is referring to His transcendental kingdom, Goloka Vṛndāvana. The Vṛndāvana from which I have come is called Bhauma Vṛndāvana, which means it is the same Vṛndāvana descended on this earth. Just as Kṛṣṇa descended on this earth through His own internal potency, similarly His <em>dhāma,</em> His abode, also descends. In other words, when Kṛṣṇa descends on this earth, He manifests Himself in that particular land, Vṛndāvana, and therefore that land is also sacred. Apart from this, Kṛṣṇa has His own abode in the spiritual sky, and this is called Goloka Vṛndāvana.</div></div><div id="bb95829" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The <em>mahātmā</em> prepares in this life to enter that transcendental abode. The human form of life can utilize nature to its best interest. Animals cannot. These facilities should be utilized in striving to become a <em>mahātmā</em> and putting an end to birth in this material world, which is characterized by threefold miseries. The threefold miseries are those that pertain to the mind or the body, natural disturbances, and miseries caused by other living entities. Whatever our position in this material world, there is always some kind of misery being inflicted upon us. Śrī Kṛṣṇa frankly says that it is not possible to avoid misery in this material world, because this world is meant for misery. Unless miseries are present, we cannot come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Misery serves as an impetus to help elevate us to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. An intelligent person understands that although he does not want misery, miseries are being inflicted upon him by force. No one wants misery, but a person should be intelligent enough to question, “Why are these miseries being forced upon me?” Unfortunately, in modern civilization, people try to set miseries aside, thinking, “Oh, why suffer? Let me cover my miseries with some intoxication.” However, the miseries of life cannot be solved by artificial intoxication. As soon as the intoxication is over, one returns to the same point. The miseries of material existence can be solved only by Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If we always remain in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we’ll be transferred to Kṛṣṇa’s planet upon leaving this material body. That is called the highest perfection.</div></div><div id="bb95830" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">People may inquire, “Well, you say that entering Kṛṣṇa’s planet constitutes the highest perfection, but we are interested in going to the moon. Is this not a kind of perfection?” Well, the desire to enter the higher planets is always there in the human mind. In fact, another name for the living entity is <em>sarva-gata,</em> which means that he wants to travel everywhere. That is the nature of the living entity. Americans who have money often go to India, Europe, or some other country, because they do not like to stagnate in one place. That is our nature, and therefore we are interested in going to the moon or wherever. But according to Kṛṣṇa, even if we attain the higher planets, we are still subject to the material miseries.</div></div><div id="bb95831" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic"><em>ābrahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ<br />punar āvartino ’rjuna<br />mām upetya tu kaunteya<br />punar janma na vidyate</em></div></div><div id="bb95832" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">“From the highest planet in the material world down to the lowest, all are places of misery wherein repeated birth and death take place.

The words <em>punar āvartinaḥ</em> mean “returning again,” or “repetition of birth and death.” We are changing bodies just as we change clothes, leaving one body and entering another. All planets are filled with living entities. We shouldn’t think that only the earth is inhabited. There are living entities on the higher planets and lower planets as well. From our experience, we can see that no place on earth is vacant of living entities. If we dig into the earth, we find some worms, and if we go into the water we find many aquatics. The air is filled with birds, and if we analyze outer space, we will find many living entities. It is illogical to conclude that there are no living entities on the other planets.

It is the duty of human life to understand these problems and attain a blissful, eternal life that is full of knowledge. Unfortunately, people in this age have forgotten the aim of life.

People do not stop to consider that however big the skyscraper may be, they will not be allowed to live there indefinitely. We should not spoil our energy, therefore, in building great cities but should employ our energy to elevate ourselves to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

It is manifested in cycles of <em>kalpas.</em> A <em>kalpa</em> is a day of Brahmā, and one day of Brahmā consists of a thousand cycles of four <em>yugas,</em> or ages: Satya, Tretā, Dvāpara, and Kali. The cycle of Satya is characterized by virtue, wisdom, and religion, there being practically no ignorance and vice, and the <em>yuga</em> lasts 1,728,000 years. In the Tretā-yuga vice is introduced, and this <em>yuga</em> lasts 1,296,000 years. In the Dvāpara-yuga there is an even greater decline in virtue and religion, vice increasing, and this <em>yuga</em> lasts 564,000 years. And finally, in Kali-yuga (the <em>yuga</em> we have now been experiencing over the past 5,000 years), there is an abundance of strife, ignorance, irreligion, and vice, true virtue being practically nonexistent, and this <em>yuga</em> lasts 432,000 years. In Kali-yuga vice increases to such a point that at the termination of the <em>yuga,</em> the Supreme Lord Himself appears as the Kalki-avatāra, vanquishes the demons, saves His devotees, and commences another Satya-yuga. Then the process is set rolling again. These four <em>yugas</em> rotating a thousand times comprise one day of Brahmā, the creator god, and the same number comprises one night. Brahmā lives one hundred of such “years” and then dies. These “hundred years” by earth calculations total 311 trillion and 40 million earth years. By these calculations, the life of Brahmā seems fantastic and interminable, but from the viewpoint of eternity, it is as brief as a lightning flash. In the Causal Ocean there are innumerable Brahmās rising and disappearing like bubbles in the Atlantic.

Elevated <em>sannyāsīs</em> are promoted to Brahmā’s particular planet, Brahmaloka, which is the highest planet in the material universe and which survives all the heavenly planets in the upper strata of the planetary system, but in due course Brahmā and all inhabitants of Brahmaloka are subject to death, according to the law of material nature. So even if we live millions and trillions of years, we have to die. Death cannot be avoided.

During this time this material manifestation – all these planets – are seen, but when night comes they are all merged in water. That is, they are annihilated.

This covering extends millions and millions of miles, and only after penetrating that covering can one enter the spiritual sky. That is open sky, eternal sky. In this verse it is stated, <em>paras tasmāt tu bhāvo ’nyaḥ:</em> “Yet there is another nature.” The word <em>bhāva</em> means another “nature.” We have experience only with this material nature, but from <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> we understand that there is a spiritual nature that is transcendental and eternal. We actually belong to that spiritual nature, because we are spirit, but presently we are covered by this material body, and therefore we are a combination of the material and spiritual. Just as we can understand that we are a combination of both natures, we should understand also that there is a spiritual world beyond this material universe. Spiritual nature is called superior, and material nature is called inferior, because without spirit, matter cannot move.</div></div><div id="bb95847" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">This cannot be understood by experimental knowledge.

Being incapable, we should not try to understand God and His kingdom by experimental knowledge. Rather, we have to understand by hearing <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> There is no other way. If we want to know who our father is, we simply have to believe our mother. We have no other way of knowing except by her. Similarly, in order to understand who God is and what His nature is, we have to accept the information given in <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> There is no question of experimenting. Once we become advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we will realize God and His nature. We can come to understand, “Yes, there is God and a spiritual kingdom, and I have to go there.

At least at night we can see that stars are twinkling and that there are innumerable planets. But beyond this <em>vyakta</em> is another nature, called <em>avyakta,</em> which is unmanifest. That is the spiritual nature, which is <em>sanātana,</em> eternal. This material nature has a beginning and an end, but that spiritual nature has neither beginning nor end. This material sky is within the covering of the <em>mahat-tattva,</em> matter. This matter is like a cloud. When there is a storm, it appears that the entire sky is covered with clouds, but actually only an insignificant part of the sky is covered. Because we are very minute, if just a few hundred miles are covered, it appears that the entire sky is covered. As soon as a wind comes and blows the clouds away, we can see the sky once again. Like the clouds, this <em>mahat-tattva</em> covering has a beginning and an end. Similarly, the material body, being a part of material nature, has a beginning and an end. The body is born, grows, stays for some time, leaves some by-products, dwindles, and then vanishes. Whatever material manifestation we see undergoes these six basic transformations. Whatever exists within material nature will ultimately be vanquished. But herein Kṛṣṇa is telling us that beyond this vanishing, cloudlike material nature, there is a superior nature, which is <em>sanātana,</em> eternal. <em>Yaḥ sa sarveṣu bhūteṣu naśyatsu na vinaśyati.</em> When this material manifestation is annihilated, that spiritual sky remains.

Its nature and features are also discussed. From this Second Canto we understand that there are spiritual airplanes in the spiritual sky, and that the living entities there – who are all liberated – travel like lightning on those planes throughout the spiritual sky. This material world is simply an imitation; whatever we see here is simply a shadow of what exists there. The material world is like a cinema, wherein we see but an imitation or a shadow of the real thing that is existing. This material world is only a shadow. As stated in <a href="/en/library/sb/1/1/1/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> (1.1.1)</a>, <em>yatra tri-sargo ’mṛṣā:</em> “This illusory material world is a combination of matter.” In store windows we often see mannequins, but no sane man thinks that these mannequins are real. He can see that they are imitations. Similarly, whatever we see here may be beautiful, just as a mannequin may be beautiful, but it is simply an imitation of the real beauty found in the spiritual world. As Śrīdhara Svāmī says, <em>yat satyatayā mithya-sargo ’pi satyavat pratiyate:</em> the spiritual world is real, and this unreal material manifestation only appears to be real. We must understand that reality will never be vanquished and that in essence reality means eternality. Therefore material pleasure, which is temporary, is not actual; real pleasure exists in Kṛṣṇa. Consequently, those who are after the reality don’t participate in this shadow pleasure.</div></div><div id="bb95850" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Thus when everything in the material world is annihilated, that spiritual nature remains eternally, and it is the purpose of human life to reach that spiritual sky.

They do not know that human life is meant for understanding spiritual reality and preparing oneself to be transferred to that reality. No one can remain here in this material world. All Vedic literatures instruct us in this way. <em>Tamasi mā jyotir gama:</em> “Don’t remain in this darkness.

In any case, its nature is dark, but the spiritual nature is full of light. When the sun is present, there is no darkness; similarly, every planet in the spiritual sky is self-luminous. Therefore there is no darkness, nor is there need of sun, moon, or electricity. The word <em>sūryo</em> means “sun,” <em>śaśāṅko</em> means “moon,” and <em>pāvakaḥ</em> means “fire” or “electricity.” So these are not required in the spiritual sky for illumination. And again, Kṛṣṇa herein says, <em>yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama:</em> “That is My supreme abode, and one who reaches it never returns to this material world.” This is stated throughout <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> Again, in the eighth chapter (<a href="/en/library/bg/8/21/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> 8.21</a>),</div></div><div id="bb95853" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic"><em>avyakto ’kṣara ity uktas<br />tam āhuḥ paramāṁ gatim<br />yaṁ prāpya na nivartante<br />tad dhāma paramaṁ mama</em></div></div><div id="bb95854" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">“That supreme abode is called unmanifested and infallible, and it is the supreme destination.

These ten senses are under the control of the mind. It is stated in this verse that with these dull material senses, we cannot understand Kṛṣṇa’s name, form, and so forth. Why is this? Kṛṣṇa is completely spiritual, and He is also absolute. Therefore His name, form, qualities, and paraphernalia are also spiritual. Due to material conditioning, or material bondage, we cannot presently understand what is spiritual, but this ignorance can be removed by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. If a man is sleeping, he can be awakened by sound vibration. You can call him, “Come on, it’s time to get up!” Although the person is unconscious, hearing is so prominent that even a sleeping man can be awakened by sound vibration. Similarly, overpowered by this material conditioning, our spiritual consciousness is presently sleeping, but it can be revived by this transcendental vibration of Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. As stated before, <em>Hare</em> refers to the energy of the Lord, and <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> and <em>Rāma</em> refer to the Lord Himself.

So we should not doubt <em>Bhagavad-gītā’s</em> authenticity.</div></div><div id="bb95865" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Therefore when Lord Kṛṣṇa says that there is a supreme abode and that we can go there, we should have faith that such an abode exists. Many philosophers think that the spiritual abode is impersonal or void. Impersonalists like the Śaṅkarites and Buddhists generally speak of the void or emptiness, but <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> does not disappoint us in this way. The philosophy of voidism has simply created atheism, because it is the nature of the living entity to want enjoyment. As soon as he thinks that his future is void, he will try to enjoy the variegatedness of this material life. Thus impersonalism leads to armchair philosophical discussions and attachment to material enjoyment. We may enjoy speculating, but no real spiritual benefit can be derived from such speculation.</div></div><div id="bb95866" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><em>Bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra ca</em> (<a href="/en/library/sb/11/2/42/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> 11.2.42</a>). Once we have developed the devotional spirit, we will become immediately detached from all kinds of material enjoyment. As soon as a hungry man eats, he feels immediate satisfaction and says, “No, I don’t want any more.

But, ceasing such engagements by experiencing a higher taste, he is fixed in consciousness.” A doctor may tell a diseased man, “Don’t eat this. Don’t eat that. Don’t have sex. Don’t. Don’t.” In this way, a diseased man is forced to accept so many “don’ts,” but inside he is thinking, “Oh, if I can just get these things, I’ll be happy.” The desires remain inside. However, when one is established in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he is so strong inside that he doesn’t experience the desire. Although he’s not impotent, he doesn’t want sex. He can marry thrice, but still be detached. <em>Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate.</em> When something superior is acquired, one naturally gives up all inferior things. That which is superior is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and atheism and impersonalism cannot give us this.

This is not a void speaking, but a person who has all the characteristics of personality in full. Just as we are talking face to face, when we reach the supreme abode we can talk to God face to face. We can play with Him, eat with Him, and everything else. This state is not acquired by mental speculation but by transcendental loving service (<em>bhaktyā labhyaḥ</em>). The words <em>tv ananyayā</em> indicate that this <em>bhakti</em> must be without adulteration. It must be unalloyed.</div></div><div id="bb95874" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Although the Supreme Personality is a person and is present in His abode in the spiritual sky, He is so widespread that everything is within Him.

Wherever we may be, we find a predominating personality. In the United States, the predominating personality is the President. However, when the next election comes, the President will have so many rivals, but in the spiritual sky the Supreme Lord has no rival. Those who want to become rivals are placed in this material world, under the conditions of material nature. In the spiritual sky there is no rivalry, and all the inhabitants therein are liberated souls. From <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> we receive information that their bodily features resemble gods. In some of the spiritual planets, God manifests a two-armed form, and in others He manifests a four-armed form. The living entities of those planets have corresponding features, and one cannot distinguish who is God and who is not. This is called <em>sārūpya-mukti</em> liberation, wherein one has the same features as the Lord. There are five kinds of liberation: <em>sāyujya, sārūpya, sālokya, sārṣṭi,</em> and <em>sāmīpya. Sāyujya-mukti</em> means merging into God’s impersonal effulgence, the <em>brahma-jyotir.</em> We have discussed this, and have concluded that the attempt to merge and lose individuality is not desirable and is very risky. <em>Sārūpya-mukti</em> means attaining a body exactly like God’s. <em>Sālokya-mukti</em> means living on the same planet with God. <em>Sārṣṭi-mukti</em> means having the opulence of God. For instance, God is very powerful, and we can become powerful like Him. That is called <em>sārṣṭi. Sāmīpya-mukti</em> means always remaining with God as one of His associates. For instance, Arjuna is always with Kṛṣṇa as His friend, and this is called <em>sāmīpya-mukti.</em> We can attain any one of these five types of liberation, but out of these five, <em>sāyujya-mukti,</em> merging into the <em>brahma-jyotir,</em> is rejected by Vaiṣṇava philosophy. According to the Vaiṣṇava philosophy, we worship God as He is and retain our separate identity eternally in order to serve Him. According to the Māyāvāda philosophy, impersonalism, one tries to lose his individual identity and merge into the existence of the Supreme. That, however, is a suicidal policy and is not recommended by Kṛṣṇa in <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em></div></div><div id="bb95876" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">This has also been rejected by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who advocated worship in separation. As stated before, the pure devotee does not even want liberation; he simply asks to remain Kṛṣṇa’s devotee birth after birth. This is Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s prayer, and the words “birth after birth” indicate that there is no liberation. This means that the devotee doesn’t care whether he is liberated or not. He simply wants to engage in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, to serve the Supreme Lord. Always wanting to engage in God’s transcendental loving service is the symptom of pure devotion. Of course, wherever a devotee is, he remains in the spiritual kingdom, even though in the material body. On his part, he does not demand any of the five types of liberation, nor anything for his personal superiority or comfort. But in order to associate with God in the spiritual planets, one must become His pure devotee.</div></div><div id="bb95877" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">For those who are not pure devotees, Lord Kṛṣṇa explains at what times one should leave the body in order to attain liberation.</div></div><div id="bb95878" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic"><em>yatra kāle tv anāvṛttim<br />āvṛttiṁ caiva yoginaḥ<br />prayātā yānti taṁ kālaṁ<br />vakṣyāmi bharatarṣabha</em></div></div><div id="bb95879" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">“O best of the Bhāratas, I shall now explain to you the different times at which, passing away from this world, one does or does not come back.” (<a href="/en/library/bg/8/23/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> 8.23</a>) In India, unlike in the West, it is common for astrologers to make minute calculations of the astronomical situation at the moment of one’s birth. Indeed, a person’s horoscope is read not only when he is born but also when he dies, in order to determine what his situation will be in the next life. All this can be determined by astrological calculation. In this verse, Lord Kṛṣṇa is accepting those astrological principles, confirming that if one leaves his body at a particular time, he may attain liberation. If one dies at one moment, he may be liberated, or if he dies at another moment, he may have to return to the material world. It is all a question of “chance,” but that chance someway or other is what one has. For the devotee, however, there is no question of chance. Whatever the astrological situation, the devotee in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is guaranteed liberation. For others, there are chances that if they leave their body at a particular moment, they may attain liberation and enter the spiritual kingdom, or they may be reborn.</div></div><div id="bb95880" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic"><em>agnir jyotir ahaḥ śuklaḥ<br />ṣaṇ-māsā uttarāyaṇam<br />tatra prayātā gacchanti<br />brahma brahma-vido janāḥ</em></div></div><div id="bb95881" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">“Those who know the Supreme Brahman pass away from the world during the influence of the fiery god, in the light, at an auspicious moment, during the fortnight of the moon and the six months when the sun travels in the north.” (<a href="/en/library/bg/8/24/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> 8.24</a>) As we all know, the sun’s movements are different: six months it is north of the equator, and six months it is south. The sun is also moving, according to Vedic calculations, and from <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> we are informed that the sun is situated at the center of the universe. Just as all the planets are moving, the sun is also moving at a speed calculated to be sixteen thousand miles per second.

Whether he dies when the sun is in the northern or southern hemisphere is of no importance. As we have already stated, if one thinks of Kṛṣṇa at the time of death, he will at once be transferred to Kṛṣṇa’s abode. Therefore Kṛṣṇa tells Arjuna to always remain in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is possible through the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa. Since Kṛṣṇa and His spiritual kingdom are nondifferent, being absolute, Kṛṣṇa and His sound vibration are the same. Simply by vibrating Kṛṣṇa’s name, we can enjoy Kṛṣṇa’s association. If we are walking down the street chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa is also going with us. If we walk down the street and look up at the sky, we may see that the sun or the moon is accompanying us. I can recall about fifty years ago, when I was a householder, my second son, who was about four years old at the time, was walking with me down the street, and he suddenly asked me, “Father, why is the moon going with us?”</div></div><div id="bb95888" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">If a material object like the moon has the power to accompany us, we can surely understand that the Supreme Lord, who is all-powerful, can always remain with us.

Animals cannot understand their miserable situations because they haven’t the reason.

Reason should be used in getting liberated from this miserable condition. However, if we engage in Kṛṣṇa consciousness twenty-four hours a day without deviation, we will go to Kṛṣṇa and not be reborn in this miserable world. \u003cem\u003eMahātmānaḥ saṁsiddhiṁ paramāṁ gatāḥ:\u003c/em\u003e those great souls who have attained the highest perfection, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, are forever freed from misery. In this verse, the word \u003cem\u003emahātmā\u003c/em\u003e refers to a Kṛṣṇa conscious man eligible to enter the abode of Kṛṣṇa. The word \u003cem\u003emahātmā\u003c/em\u003e does not refer to a political leader like Mahatma Gandhi but to a great soul, a pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa.2e:T685,The \u003cem\u003emahātmā\u003c/em\u003e prepares in this life to enter that transcendental abode. The human form of life can utilize nature to its best interest. Animals cannot. These facilities should be utilized in striving to become a \u003cem\u003emahātmā\u003c/em\u003e and putting an end to birth in this material world, which is characterized by threefold miseries. The threefold miseries are those that pertain to the mind or the body, natural disturbances, and miseries caused by other living entities. Whatever our position in this material world, there is always some kind of misery being inflicted upon us. Śrī Kṛṣṇa frankly says that it is not possible to avoid misery in this material world, because this world is meant for misery. Unless miseries are present, we cannot come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Misery serves as an impetus to help elevate us to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. An intelligent person understands that although he does not want misery, miseries are being inflicted upon him by force. No one wants misery, but a person should be intelligent enough to question, “Why are these miseries being forced upon me?” Unfortunately, in modern civilization, people try to set miseries aside, thinking, “Oh, why suffer? Let me cover my miseries with some intoxication.” However, the miseries of life cannot be so"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"lved by artificial intoxication. As soon as the intoxication is over, one returns to the same point. The miseries of material existence can be solved only by Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If we always remain in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we’ll be transferred to Kṛṣṇa’s planet upon leaving this material body. That is called the highest perfection.2f:T454,The universe is divided into fourteen planetary systems (\u003cem\u003ecaturdaśa-bhuvana\u003c/em\u003e) – seven lower and seven higher. The earth is situated in the middle. In this verse, Śrī Kṛṣṇa says, \u003cem\u003eābrahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ:\u003c/em\u003e even if one enters the highest planet, Brahmaloka, there is still birth and death. The words \u003cem\u003epunar āvartinaḥ\u003c/em\u003e mean “returning again,” or “repetition of birth and death.” We are changing bodies just as we change clothes, leaving one body and entering another. All planets are filled with living entities. We shouldn’t think that only the earth is inhabited. There are living entities on the higher planets and lower planets as well. From our experience, we can see that no place on earth is vacant of living entities. If we dig into the earth, we find some worms, and if we go into the water we find many aquatics. The air is filled with birds, and if we analyze outer space, we will find many living entities. It is illogical to conclude that there are no living entities on the other planets. To the contrary, they are \u003cem\u003efull\u003c/em\u003e of living entities.30:T508,In any case, Kṛṣṇa says that from the highest planet to the lowest planet, there is repetition of birth and death. Yet again, as in the former verse, He says, \u003cem\u003emām upetya:\u003c/em\u003e “If you reach My planet, you don’t have to return to this miserable material world.” To stress this point, Śrī Kṛṣṇa repeats that upon reaching Goloka Vṛndāvana, His eternal abode, one is liberated from the cycle of birth and death and attains eternal life. It is the duty of human life to understand these problems and attain a blissful, eternal life that is full "])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"of knowledge. Unfortunately, people in this age have forgotten the aim of life. Why? \u003cem\u003eDurāśayā ye bahir-artha-māninaḥ\u003c/em\u003e (\u003ca href=\"/en/library/sb/7/5/31/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e 7.5.31\u003c/a\u003e). People have been trapped by the material glitter – by skyscrapers, big factories, and political activities. People do not stop to consider that however big the skyscraper may be, they will not be allowed to live there indefinitely. We should not spoil our energy, therefore, in building great cities but should employ our energy to elevate ourselves to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not a religious formula or some spiritual recreation but is the most important factor in our lives.31:T715,The duration of the material universe is limited. It is manifested in cycles of \u003cem\u003ekalpas.\u003c/em\u003e A \u003cem\u003ekalpa\u003c/em\u003e is a day of Brahmā, and one day of Brahmā consists of a thousand cycles of four \u003cem\u003eyugas,\u003c/em\u003e or ages: Satya, Tretā, Dvāpara, and Kali. The cycle of Satya is characterized by virtue, wisdom, and religion, there being practically no ignorance and vice, and the \u003cem\u003eyuga\u003c/em\u003e lasts 1,728,000 years. In the Tretā-yuga vice is introduced, and this \u003cem\u003eyuga\u003c/em\u003e lasts 1,296,000 years. In the Dvāpara-yuga there is an even greater decline in virtue and religion, vice increasing, and this \u003cem\u003eyuga\u003c/em\u003e lasts 564,000 years. And finally, in Kali-yuga (the \u003cem\u003eyuga\u003c/em\u003e we have now been experiencing over the past 5,000 years), there is an abundance of strife, ignorance, irreligion, and vice, true virtue being practically nonexistent, and this \u003cem\u003eyuga\u003c/em\u003e lasts 432,000 years. In Kali-yuga vice increases to such a point that at the termination of the \u003cem\u003eyuga,\u003c/em\u003e the Supreme Lord Himself appears as the Kalki-avatāra, vanquishes the demons, saves His devotees, and commences another Satya-yuga. Then the process is set rolling again. These four \u003cem\u003eyugas\u003c/em\u003e rotating a thousand times comprise one day of Brahmā, the creator god, and the same number comprises one night. Brahmā lives one hundr"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"ed of such “years” and then dies. These “hundred years” by earth calculations total 311 trillion and 40 million earth years. By these calculations, the life of Brahmā seems fantastic and interminable, but from the viewpoint of eternity, it is as brief as a lightning flash. In the Causal Ocean there are innumerable Brahmās rising and disappearing like bubbles in the Atlantic. Brahmā and his creation are all part of the material universe, and therefore they are in constant flux.32:T5b5,We cannot calculate the length and breadth of this universe. There are millions and millions of universes like this within this material world, and above this material world is the spiritual sky, where the planets are all eternal. Life on those planets is also eternal. This material manifestation comprises only one fourth of the entire creation. \u003cem\u003eEkāṁśena sthito jagat. Ekāṁśena\u003c/em\u003e means “one fourth.” Three fourths of the creation is beyond this material sky, which is covered like a ball. This covering extends millions and millions of miles, and only after penetrating that covering can one enter the spiritual sky. That is open sky, eternal sky. In this verse it is stated, \u003cem\u003eparas tasmāt tu bhāvo ’nyaḥ:\u003c/em\u003e “Yet there is another nature.” The word \u003cem\u003ebhāva\u003c/em\u003e means another “nature.” We have experience only with this material nature, but from \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e we understand that there is a spiritual nature that is transcendental and eternal. We actually belong to that spiritual nature, because we are spirit, but presently we are covered by this material body, and therefore we are a combination of the material and spiritual. Just as we can understand that we are a combination of both natures, we should understand also that there is a spiritual world beyond this material universe. Spiritual nature is called superior, and material nature is called inferior, because without spirit, matter cannot move.33:T6ad,The word \u003cem\u003evyakta\u003c/em\u003e means “manifest.” This material universe that we a"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"re seeing (or partially seeing) before us is manifest. At least at night we can see that stars are twinkling and that there are innumerable planets. But beyond this \u003cem\u003evyakta\u003c/em\u003e is another nature, called \u003cem\u003eavyakta,\u003c/em\u003e which is unmanifest. That is the spiritual nature, which is \u003cem\u003esanātana,\u003c/em\u003e eternal. This material nature has a beginning and an end, but that spiritual nature has neither beginning nor end. This material sky is within the covering of the \u003cem\u003emahat-tattva,\u003c/em\u003e matter. This matter is like a cloud. When there is a storm, it appears that the entire sky is covered with clouds, but actually only an insignificant part of the sky is covered. Because we are very minute, if just a few hundred miles are covered, it appears that the entire sky is covered. As soon as a wind comes and blows the clouds away, we can see the sky once again. Like the clouds, this \u003cem\u003emahat-tattva\u003c/em\u003e covering has a beginning and an end. Similarly, the material body, being a part of material nature, has a beginning and an end. The body is born, grows, stays for some time, leaves some by-products, dwindles, and then vanishes. Whatever material manifestation we see undergoes these six basic transformations.

If one dies at one moment, he may be liberated, or if he dies at another moment, he may have to return to the material world. It is all a question of “chance,” but that chance someway or other is what one has. For the devotee, however, there is no question of chance.

If we walk down the street and look up at the sky, we may see that the sun or the moon is accompanying us. I can recall about fifty years ago, when I was a householder, my second son, who was about four years old at the time, was walking with me down the street, and he suddenly asked me, “Father, why is the moon going with us?”3c:T4c8,But in this verse, Śrī Kṛṣṇa gives the solution: \u003cem\u003emām upetya punar janma nāpnuvanti.\u003c/em\u003e That is, “If one attains My platform, he does not come back again to this place of misery.” Unfortunately, in the mode of ignorance, people cannot understand that they are in a miserable situation.

The threefold miseries are those that pertain to the mind or the body, natural disturbances, and miseries caused by other living entities. Whatever our position in this material world, there is always some kind of misery being inflicted upon us. Śrī Kṛṣṇa frankly says that it is not possible to avoid misery in this material world, because this world is meant for misery. Unless miseries are present, we cannot come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Misery serves as an impetus to help elevate us to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. An intelligent person understands that although he does not want misery, miseries are being inflicted upon him by force. No one wants misery, but a person should be intelligent enough to question, “Why are these miseries being forced upon me?” Unfortunately, in modern civilization, people try to set miseries aside, thinking, “Oh, why suffer? Let me cover my miseries with some intoxication.” However, the miseries of life cannot be solved by artificial intoxication. As soon as the intoxication is over, one returns to the same point. The miseries of material existence can be solved only by Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If we always remain in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we’ll be transferred to Kṛṣṇa’s planet upon leaving this material body.

Then our happiness is assured.\"}}]}]]}]]],[\"$\",\"$L45\",null,{\"pager\":\"$2b:props:children:0:props:children:props:page:pager\",\"activeView\":\"$13:props:activeView\"}]]}]]}],\"$L46\",[\"$\",\"$L25\",null,{\"locale\":\"en\"}]]}]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"47:I[9322,[\"77\",\"static/chunks/5d4ed50a-f7c8be9a807e6ca6.js\",\"825\",\"static/chunks/31d7845b-021f9da3f9697e63.js\",\"971\",\"static/chunks/9520ad3f-48ea89eb93611988.js\",\"570\",\"static/chunks/061bc62c-731c4c5361c0b1a6.js\",\"80\",\"static/chunks/726d83c0-3c02be48ed596e6c.js\",\"462\",\"static/chunks/ccbff8d1-cc06647d0fb1d006.js\",\"244\",\"static/chunks/244-e90cecb8df7c71e4.js\",\"643\",\"static/chunks/643-27761253fa6e620a.js\",\"718\",\"static/chunks/718-a66a69860517a935.js\",\"685\",\"static/chunks/685-ce87992f230bf79b.js\",\"75\",\"static/chunks/75-09b37c6ebdea24fa.js\",\"755\",\"static/chunks/755-4e4c0d39ad776baf.js\",\"851\",\"static/chunks/851-b5ca56f5cce56349.js\",\"926\",\"static/chunks/926-7b54e3f38d066b8f.js\",\"963\",\"static/chunks/app/%5Blocale%5D/%5B...path%5D/page-089706ccb06c84ad.js\"],\"default\"]\n3a:[\"$\",\"div\",\"/en/library/pop/10/\",{\"className\":\"select-none mb-6 text-xs sm:text-base font-sans\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"$L29\",null,{\"className\":\"bg-vb-header-top/80 inline-block border border-vb-header-top border-opacity-20 rounded-md p-2 sm:px-3 mr-1 sm:mr-3 mb-2 whitespace-nowrap text-xs md:text-base text-vb-header-top-text\",\"href\":\"/en/library/pop/10/\",\"children\":\"Default View\"}],false,\"$undefined\",[\"$\",\"$L47\",null,{\"className\":\"bg-vb-header-top/30 hover:bg-vb-header-top/40 inline-block border border-vb-header-top border-opacity-20 rounded-md p-2 sm:px-3 mr-1 sm:mr-3 mb-2 whitespace-nowrap text-xs md:text-base text-vb-header-top-text cursor-pointer\",\"page\":\"$2b:props:children:0:props:children:props:page\",\"activeView\":\"$13:props:activeView\",\"children\":[[\"Dual Language \",[\"$\",\"span\",\"hideSmall0\",{\"className\":\"hidden sm:inline\",\"children\":[\"View\"]}]],false]}]]}]\n48:T41c,Vinod Bapat and Meenal Bapat; Mahavisnupriya dasi \u0026amp; Gostavihari das;   Kuldip Persaud; Gagan Kangovi; Rajendra and Geeta Ramchandani; NIOS - North American Institute for Oriental and Classical Studies; Jaykumar Prabhakar; Anantha SriSimha das, Spore; Bharat Vyas; HG Lakshmipati Narayan Das; HG Ragatmika Gopika Devi Dasi; Shri Chander Mohan Gilhotra; HG Prashant Mukund Das; Shri Trilok Singh"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1," Grover; Aneesh Koppula; Ronak Talati; Bhargav Ashok; J.K Ahuja; Akiralali; Radhapati Das; Bimal Gupta; Rajasa das; Aishwarya Balaraj; Yogendra Sharad Puranik; Riya and Tejal Chopade; Devarajula Pradeep Kumar (Saroornagar, Hyderabad); Late Chetana Dilip Bhatt; \u003ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://in.linkedin.com/in/indradyumna-swami\"\u003eIndradyumna Swami\u003c/a\u003e; Sachin; Geetanjali Nath; Mario; Joeie; Susheela and Rama Krishna Reddy Patlolla; Jai Devaki Parks; Ashmi Chakraborty; Hari-kirtana das; Ramesta das; Prasad Buddhavarapu; dasa; Kresna Sucandra; Late Mr. S.
