s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Long, long ago, there was an assembly of great sages on the bank of the river Sarasvatī who performed a great sacrifice of the name Satra. In such assemblies, the great sages present usually discuss Vedic subject matters and philosophical topics, and in this particular meeting the following question was raised: The three predominating deities of this material world, namely Lord Brahmā, Lord Viṣṇu and Lord Śiva, are directing all the affairs of this cosmos, but who among them is the Supreme? After much discussion on this question, the great sage named Bhṛgu, the son of Lord Brahmā, was deputed to test all three predominating deities and report to the assembly as to who is the greatest.</div></div><div id="bb92711" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Being thus deputed, the great sage Bhṛgu Muni first of all went to his father’s residence in Brahmaloka. The three deities are the controllers of the three material qualities, namely the qualities of goodness, passion and ignorance. The plan decided upon by the sages was for Bhṛgu to test which one of the predominating deities possesses the quality of goodness in full. Therefore, when Bhṛgu Muni reached his father, Lord Brahmā, because Bhṛgu wanted to test whether Brahmā had the quality of goodness, he purposely did not offer his respects to his father, either by offering obeisances or by offering prayers. It is the duty of a son or a disciple to offer respects and recite suitable prayers when he approaches his father or spiritual master. But Bhṛgu Muni purposely failed to offer respects, just to see Lord Brahmā’s reaction to this negligence. Lord Brahmā was very angry at his son’s impudence, and he showed signs which definitely proved this to be so. He was even prepared to condemn Bhṛgu by cursing him, but because Bhṛgu was his son, Lord Brahmā controlled his anger with his great intelligence. This means that although the quality of passion was prominent in Lord Brahmā, he had the power to control it. Lord Brahmā’s anger and his controlling his anger are likened to fire and water. Water is produced from fire at the beginning of creation, but fire can be extinguished with water. Similarly, although Lord Brahmā was very angry due to his quality of passion, he could still control his passion because Bhṛgu Muni was his son.</div></div><div id="bb92712" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">After testing Lord Brahmā, Bhṛgu Muni went directly to Mount Kailāsa, where Lord Śiva resides. Bhṛgu Muni happened to be Lord Śiva’s brother. Therefore, as soon as Bhṛgu Muni approached, Lord Śiva was very glad and personally rose to embrace him. But when Lord Śiva approached, Bhṛgu Muni refused to embrace him. “My dear brother,” he said, “you are always very impure. Because you smear your body with ashes, you are not very clean. Please do not touch me.” When Bhṛgu Muni refused to embrace his brother, saying that Lord Śiva was impure, the latter became very angry with him. </div></div><div id="bb92713" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">It is said that an offense can be committed either with the body, with the mind or by speech. Bhṛgu Muni’s first offense, committed toward Lord Brahmā, was an offense with the mind. His second offense, committed toward Lord Śiva by insulting him, criticizing him for unclean habits, was an offense by speech. Because the quality of ignorance is prominent in Lord Śiva, when he heard Bhṛgu’s insult his eyes immediately became red with anger. With uncontrollable rage, he took up his trident and prepared to kill Bhṛgu Muni. At that time Lord Śiva’s wife, Pārvatī, was present. Her personality, like Lord Śiva’s, is a mixture of the three qualities, and therefore she is called Triguṇamayī. In this case, she saved the situation by evoking Lord Śiva’s quality of goodness. She fell down at the feet of her husband, and with her sweet words she talked him out of killing Bhṛgu Muni.</div></div><div id="bb92714" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">After being saved from the anger of Lord Śiva, Bhṛgu Muni went directly to the planet Śvetadvīpa, where Lord Viṣṇu was lying on a bed of flowers in the company of His wife, the goddess of fortune, who was engaged in massaging His lotus feet. There Bhṛgu Muni purposely committed the greatest sin by offending Lord Viṣṇu by his bodily activities. The first offense committed by Bhṛgu Muni was mental, the second offense was vocal, and the third offense was corporal. These different offenses are progressively greater in degree. An offense committed within the mind is a positive offense, the same offense committed verbally is comparatively more grave, and when committed by bodily action it is superlative in offensiveness. So Bhṛgu Muni committed the greatest offense by kicking the chest of the Lord in the presence of the goddess of fortune. Of course, Lord Viṣṇu is all-merciful. He did not become angry at the activities of Bhṛgu Muni, for Bhṛgu Muni was a great <em>brāhmaṇa.</em> A <em>brāhmaṇa</em> is to be excused even if he sometimes commits an offense, and Lord Viṣṇu set the example. Yet it is said that from the time of this incident the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, has not been very favorably disposed toward the <em>brāhmaṇas,</em> and therefore, because the goddess of fortune withholds her benedictions from them, the <em>brāhmaṇas</em> are generally very poor. Bhṛgu Muni’s kicking the chest of Lord Viṣṇu  was certainly a great offense, but Lord Viṣṇu is so great that He did not care. The so-called <em>brāhmaṇas</em> of the Kali-yuga are sometimes very proud that a great <em>brāhmaṇa</em> like Bhṛgu Muni could touch the chest of Lord Viṣṇu with his foot. But in fact when Bhṛgu Muni kicked the chest of Lord Viṣṇu it was the greatest offense, although Lord Viṣṇu, being greatly magnanimous, did not take it very seriously.</div></div><div id="bb92715" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Instead of being angry or cursing Bhṛgu Muni, Lord Viṣṇu immediately got up from His bed along with His wife, the goddess of fortune, and offered respectful obeisances to the <em>brāhmaṇa.</em> He addressed Bhṛgu Muni as follows: “My dear <em>brāhmaṇa</em>, it is My greatest fortune that you have come here. Please, therefore, sit down on this cushion for a few minutes. My dear <em>brāhmaṇa,</em> I am very sorry that when you first entered My home I could not receive you properly. It was a great offense on My part, and I beg you to pardon Me. You are so pure and great that the water which washes your feet can purify even the places of pilgrimage. Therefore, I request you to purify the Vaikuṇṭha planet where I live with My associates. My dear Father, O great sage, I know that your feet are very soft, like a lotus flower, and that My chest is as hard as a thunderbolt. I am therefore afraid that you may have felt some pain by kicking My chest. Let Me touch your feet to relieve the pain you have suffered.” Lord Viṣṇu then began to massage the feet of Bhṛgu Muni.</div></div><div id="bb92716" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The Lord continued to address Bhṛgu Muni. “My dear lord,” He said, “My chest has now become sanctified because of the touch of your feet, and I am now assured that the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, will be very glad to live there perpetually.” Another name for Lakṣmī is Cañcalā, indicating that she does not stay in one place for a long time. Therefore, we see that a rich man’s family sometimes becomes poor after a few generations, and sometimes we see that a poor man’s family becomes very rich. Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune, is Cañcalā in this material world, whereas in the Vaikuṇṭha planets she eternally lives at the lotus feet of the Lord. Because Lakṣmī is famous as Cañcalā, Lord Nārāyaṇa indicated that she might not have been living perpetually by His chest, but because His chest had been touched by the feet of Bhṛgu Muni, it was now sanctified, and there was no chance that the goddess of fortune would leave. Bhṛgu Muni, however, could understand his position and that of the Lord, and he was struck with wonder at the behavior of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because of his gratitude, his voice choked up, and he was unable to reply to the words of the Lord. Tears glided from his eyes, and he could not say anything. He simply stood silently before the Lord.</div></div><div id="bb92717" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">After testing Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva and Lord Viṣṇu, Bhṛgu Muni returned to the assembly of great sages on the bank of the river Sarasvatī and described his experience. After hearing him with great attention, the sages concluded that of all the predominating deities, Lord Viṣṇu is certainly the greatest. In <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> these great sages are described as <em>brahma-vādinām. Brahma-vādinām</em> means those who talk about the Absolute Truth but have not yet come to a conclusion. Generally <em>brahma-vādī</em> refers to the impersonalists or to those who are students of the <em>Vedas.</em> It is to be understood, therefore, that all the gathered sages were serious students of the Vedic literature but had not come to a definite conclusion as to who is the Supreme Absolute Personality of Godhead. But after hearing of Bhṛgu Muni’s experience in meeting all three predominating deities – Lord Śiva, Lord Brahmā and Lord Viṣṇu – the sages concluded that Lord Viṣṇu is the Supreme Truth, the Personality of Godhead. It is said in <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> that after hearing the details from Bhṛgu Muni the sages were astonished because although Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva were immediately agitated, Lord Viṣṇu, in spite of being kicked by Bhṛgu Muni, was not agitated in the least. The example is given that small lamps may be agitated by a slight breeze, but the greatest lamp or the greatest illuminating source, the sun, is never moved, even by the greatest hurricane. One’s greatness has to be estimated by one’s ability to tolerate provoking situations. The sages gathered on the bank of the river Sarasvatī concluded that one who wants actual peace and freedom from all fear should take shelter of the lotus feet of Viṣṇu. Since Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva lost their peaceful attitude upon a slight provocation, how can they maintain the peace and tranquillity of their devotees? As for Lord Viṣṇu, however, it is stated in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> that anyone who accepts Lord Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa as the supreme friend attains the highest perfection of peaceful life.</div></div><div id="bb92718" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The sages thus concluded that by following the principles of <em>vaiṣṇava-dharma</em> one becomes actually perfect, but that if one follows all the religious principles of a particular sect and does not become advanced in understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, all such labor of love is fruitless. To execute religious principles means to come to the platform of perfect knowledge. If one comes to the platform of perfect knowledge, then he will be uninterested in material affairs. Perfect knowledge means knowledge of one’s own self and the Supreme Self. The Supreme Self and the individual self, although one in quality, are different in quantity. This analytical understanding of knowledge is perfect. Simply to understand “I am not matter; I am spirit” is not perfect knowledge. The real religious principle is devotional service, or <em>bhakti.</em> This is confirmed in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> where Lord Kṛṣṇa says, “Give up all other religious principles and simply surrender unto Me.” Therefore, the term <em>dharma</em> applies only to <em>vaiṣṇava-dharma,</em> or <em>bhagavad-dharma,</em> by following which one automatically achieves all good qualities and advancements in life.</div></div><div id="bb92719" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The highest perfectional knowledge is knowledge of the Supreme Lord. He cannot be understood by any process of religion other than devotional service; therefore, the immediate result of perfect knowledge is achieved by executing devotional service. After attainment of knowledge, one becomes uninterested in the material world. This is not because of dry philosophical speculation. The devotees become uninterested in the material world not simply because of theoretical understanding but because of practical experience. When a devotee realizes the effect of association with the Supreme Lord, he naturally hates the association of so-called society, friendship and love. This detachment is not dry but is due to achieving a higher status of life by relishing transcendental mellows. It is further stated in <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> that after attainment of such knowledge and such detachment from material sense gratification, one’s advancement in the eight opulences attained through mystic <em>yoga</em> practice, such as the <em>aṇimā, laghimā</em> and <em>prāpti siddhis,</em> is also achieved without separate effort. The perfect example is Mahārāja Ambarīṣa. He was not a mystic <em>yogī</em> but a great devotee, yet in a disagreement with Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, the great mystic Durvāsā was defeated in the presence of the King’s devotional attitude. In other words, a devotee does not need to practice the mystic <em>yoga</em> system to achieve power. The power is behind him by the grace of the Lord, just as when a small child is surrendered to a powerful father, all the powers of the father are behind him.</div></div><div id="bb92720" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">When a person becomes famous as a devotee of the Lord, his reputation is never to be extinguished. Lord Caitanya, when discoursing with Rāmānanda Rāya, questioned, “What is the greatest fame?” Rāmānanda Rāya replied that to be known as a pure devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa is the perfect fame. The conclusion, therefore, is that <em> viṣṇu-dharma,</em> or the religion of devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is meant for persons who are thoughtful. By proper utilization of thoughtfulness, one comes to the stage of thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one becomes free from the contamination of the faulty association of the material world, and thus one becomes peaceful. The world is in a disturbed condition because of a scarcity of such peaceful devotees in human society. Unless one is a devotee, one cannot be equal to all living entities. A devotee is equally disposed toward the animals, the human beings and all living entities because he sees every living entity as a part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. In the <em>Īśopaniṣad</em> it is clearly stated that one who has come to the stage of seeing all living beings equally does not hate anyone or favor anyone. The devotee does not hanker to possess more than he requires. Devotees are therefore <em>akiñcana:</em> in any condition of life a devotee is satisfied. It is said that a devotee is even-minded whether he is in hell or in heaven. A devotee is callous to all subjects other than his engagement in devotional service. This mode of life is the highest perfectional stage, from which one can be elevated to the spiritual world, back home, back to Godhead. The devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are especially attracted by the highest material quality, goodness, and the qualified <em>brāhmaṇa</em> is the symbolic representation of this goodness. Therefore, a devotee is attached to the brahminical stage of life. He is not very interested in passion or ignorance, although these qualities also emanate from the Supreme Lord, Viṣṇu. In <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> the devotees are described as <em>nipuṇa-buddhayaḥ,</em> which means that they are the most intelligent class of men. Uninfluenced by attachment or hatred, the devotee lives very peacefully and is not agitated by the influence of passion and ignorance.</div></div><div id="bb92721" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">It may be questioned here why a devotee should be attached to the quality of goodness in the material world if he is transcendental to all material qualities. The answer is that there are different kinds of people existing in the modes of material nature. Those in the mode of ignorance are called Rākṣasas, those in the mode of passion are called <em>asuras,</em> and those in the mode of goodness are called <em>suras,</em> or demigods. Under the direction of the Supreme Lord, these three classes of men are created by material nature, but those in the mode of goodness have a greater chance to be elevated to the spiritual world, back home, back to Godhead.</div></div><div id="bb92722" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Thus all the sages who assembled on the bank of the river Sarasvatī to try to determine who is the supreme predominating deity became freed from all doubts about Viṣṇu worship. All of them thereafter engaged in devotional service, and thus they achieved the desired result and went back to Godhead.</div></div><div id="bb92723" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Those who are actually eager to be liberated from material entanglement would do well to accept at once the conclusion given by Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī. In the beginning of <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</em> which is spoken by Śukadeva Gosvāmī, it is said that hearing <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> is extremely conducive to liberation. The same fact is now confirmed by Sūta Gosvāmī: if anyone who is traveling aimlessly within this material world cares to hear the nectarean words spoken by Śukadeva Gosvāmī, certainly he will come to the right conclusion, which is that simply by discharging devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead one will be able to stop the fatigue of perpetually migrating from one material body to another. In other words, one who becomes fixed in loving devotional service to Viṣṇu will certainly be able to get relief from this journey of material life, and the process is very simple: one has to give aural reception to the sweet words spoken by Śukadeva Gosvāmī in the form of <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</em></div></div><div id="bb92724" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Another conclusion is that we should never consider the demigods, even Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā, to be on an equal level with Lord Viṣṇu. If we do this, then according to the<em> Padma Purāṇa</em> we are immediately categorized as atheists. Also, in the Vedic literature known as <em>Hari-vaṁśa</em> it is stated that only the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, is to be worshiped and that the Hare Kṛṣṇa <em>mahā-mantra,</em> or any such <em>viṣṇu-mantra,</em> is always to be chanted. In the Second Canto of <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</em> Lord Brahmā says, “Both Lord Śiva and I are engaged by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to act in different capacities under His direction.” In the <em>Caitanya-caritāmṛta</em> it is also stated that the only master is Kṛṣṇa and that all others in all categories of life are servants of Kṛṣṇa only.</div></div><div id="bb92725" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> it is confirmed by the Lord that there is no truth superior to Kṛṣṇa. Śukadeva Gosvāmī also, in order to draw attention to the fact that among all <em>viṣṇu-tattva</em> forms Lord Kṛṣṇa is one hundred percent the Supreme Personality of Godhead, narrated the story of an incident which took place when Lord Kṛṣṇa was present.</div></div><div id="bb92726" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Once upon a time in Dvārakā, a <em>brāhmaṇa’s</em> wife gave birth to a child. Unfortunately, however, just after being born and touching the ground, the child immediately died. The <em>brāhmaṇa</em> father took the child and went directly to the palace of the king. The <em>brāhmaṇa</em> was very upset because of the untimely death of the child in the presence of his young father and mother. Thus his mind became very much disturbed. Formerly, when there were responsible kings, up to the time of Dvāpara-yuga, when Lord Kṛṣṇa was present, the king was liable to be blamed for the untimely death of a child in the presence of his parents. Similarly, such responsibility was there during the time of Lord Rāmacandra. As we have explained in the First Canto of <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</em> the king was so responsible for the comforts of the citizens that he was to see that there was not even excessive heat or cold. Now the <em>brāhmaṇa</em> whose child had died, thinking there was no fault on his own part, immediately went to the palace door with the dead child in his arms and accused the king as follows.</div></div><div id="bb92727" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">“The present king, Ugrasena, is envious of the <em>brāhmaṇas</em>!” The exact word used in this connection is <em>brahma-dviṣaḥ.</em> One who is envious of the <em>Vedas,</em> of a qualified <em>brāhmaṇa</em> or of the <em>brāhmaṇa</em> caste is called <em>brahma-dviṣ.</em> So the king was accused of being <em>brahma-dviṣ.</em> He was also accused of being <em>śaṭha-dhī,</em> falsely intelligent. The executive head of a state must be very intelligent to see to the comforts of the citizens, but according to the <em>brāhmaṇa</em> the king was not at all intelligent, although he was occupying the royal throne. Therefore the <em>brāhmaṇa</em> also called him <em>lubdha,</em> which means “greedy.” In other words, a king or an executive head of state should not occupy the exalted post of president or king if he is greedy and self-interested. But it is natural that an executive head becomes self-interested when he is attached to material enjoyment. Therefore, another word used here is <em>viṣayātmanaḥ.</em></div></div><div id="bb92728" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The <em>brāhmaṇa</em> also accused the king of being <em>kṣatra-bandhu,</em> which refers to a person born in the family of <em>kṣatriyas,</em> or the royal order, but lacking the qualifications of a royal personality. A king should protect brahminical culture and should be very alert to the welfare of his citizens; he should not be greedy due to attachment to material enjoyment. If a person with no qualifications represents himself as a <em>kṣatriya</em> of the royal order, he is not called a <em>kṣatriya</em> but a <em>kṣatra-bandhu.</em> Similarly, if a person is born of a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> father but has no brahminical qualification, he is called a <em>brahma-bandhu</em> or <em>dvija-bandhu.</em> This means that a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> or a <em>kṣatriya</em> is not accepted simply by birth. One has to qualify himself for the particular position; only then is he accepted as a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> or a <em>kṣatriya.</em></div></div><div id="bb92729" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Thus the <em>brāhmaṇa</em> charged that his newly born baby was dead due to the disqualifications of the king. The <em>brāhmaṇa</em> took it to be most unnatural, and therefore he held the king responsible. We also find in Vedic history that if a <em>kṣatriya</em> king was irresponsible, sometimes a consulting board of <em>brāhmaṇas</em> maintained by the monarchy would dethrone him. Considering all these points, it appears that the post of monarch in the Vedic civilization is a very responsible one.</div></div><div id="bb92730" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The <em>brāhmaṇa</em> therefore said, “No one should offer respects or worship to a king whose only business is envy. Such a king spends his time either hunting and killing animals in the forest or killing citizens for criminal acts. He has no self-control and possesses bad character. If such a king is worshiped or honored by the citizens, the citizens will never be happy. They will always remain poor, full of anxieties and aggrievement, and always unhappy.” In modern politics the post of monarch has been abolished, and the president is not held responsible for the comforts of the citizens. In this Age of Kali, the executive head of a state somehow or other gets votes and is elected to an exalted post, but the condition of the citizens continues to be full of anxiety, distress, unhappiness and dissatisfaction.</div></div><div id="bb92731" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The <em>brāhmaṇa’s</em> second child also died at birth, and the third also. He had nine children, who all died at birth, and each time he came to the gate of the palace to accuse the king. When the <em>brāhmaṇa</em> came to accuse the king of Dvārakā for the ninth time, Arjuna happened to be present with Kṛṣṇa. On hearing that a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> was accusing the king of not properly protecting him, Arjuna became inquisitive and approached the <em>brāhmaṇa.</em> He said, “My dear <em>brāhmaṇa,</em> why do you say that there are no proper <em>kṣatriyas</em> to protect the citizens of your country? Is there not even someone who can pretend to be a <em>kṣatriya,</em> who can carry a bow and arrow at least to make a show of protection? Do you think that all the royal personalities in this country simply engage in performing sacrifices with the <em>brāhmaṇas</em> but have no chivalrous power?” Thus Arjuna indicated that <em>kṣatriyas</em> should not sit back comfortably on the pretext of performing Vedic rituals but must rather be very chivalrous in protecting the citizens. <em>Brāhmaṇas,</em> being engaged in spiritual activities, are not expected to do anything which requires physical endeavor. Therefore, they need to be protected by the <em>kṣatriyas</em> so that they will not be disturbed in the execution of their higher occupational duties.</div></div><div id="bb92732" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">“If the <em>brāhmaṇas</em> feel unwanted separation from their wives and children,” Arjuna continued, “and the <em>kṣatriya</em> kings do not take care of them, then such <em>kṣatriyas</em> are to be considered no more than stage players. In dramatic performances in the theater, an actor may play the part of a king, but no one expects any benefits from such a make-believe king. Similarly, if the king or the executive head of a state cannot give protection to the head of the social structure, he is considered merely a bluffer. Such executive heads simply live for their own livelihood while occupying exalted posts as chiefs of state. My lord, I promise that I shall give protection to your children, and if I am unable to do so, then I shall enter into blazing fire so that the sinful contamination which has infected me will be counteracted.”</div></div><div id="bb92733" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Upon hearing Arjuna speak in this way, the <em>brāhmaṇa</em> replied, “My dear Arjuna, Lord Balarāma is present, but He could not give protection to my children. Lord Kṛṣṇa is also present, but He also could not give them protection. There are also many other heroes, such as Pradyumna and Aniruddha, carrying bows and arrows, but they could not protect my children.” The <em>brāhmaṇa</em> directly hinted that Arjuna could not do that which was impossible for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He felt that Arjuna was promising something beyond his power. The <em>brāhmaṇa</em> said, “I consider your promise to be like that of an inexperienced child.

My name is Arjuna, and I carry the bow known as Gāṇḍīva. You cannot insult me, for I have satisfied even Lord Śiva by my prowess when we were both hunting in the forest. I had a fight with Lord Śiva, who appeared before me as a hunter, and when I satisfied him by my prowess he gave me the weapon known as Pāśupata. Do not doubt my chivalry. I shall bring back your sons even if I have to fight with death personified.” When the <em>brāhmaṇa</em> was assured by Arjuna in such exalted words, he was somehow or other convinced, and thus he returned home.</div></div><div id="bb92735" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">When the <em>brāhmaṇa’s</em> wife was to give birth to another child, the <em>brāhmaṇa</em> began to chant, “My dear Arjuna, please come now and save my child.” After hearing him, Arjuna immediately prepared himself by touching sanctified water and uttering holy <em>mantras</em> to protect his bows and arrows from danger. He specifically took the arrow presented to him by Lord Śiva, and while going out he remembered Lord Śiva and his great favor.

This is another instance of how a person takes shelter of the demigods. This is explained in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā: kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ prapadyante ’nya-devatāḥ.</em> “A person who loses his intelligence because of greed and lust forgets the Supreme Personality of Godhead and takes shelter of the demigods.” Of course, Arjuna was not an ordinary living entity, but because of his friendly dealings with Kṛṣṇa he thought that Kṛṣṇa was unable to give protection to the <em>brāhmaṇa</em> and that he would do better to remember Lord Śiva. Later it was proved that Arjuna’s taking shelter of Lord Śiva instead of Kṛṣṇa was not at all successful. Arjuna, however, did his best by chanting different <em>mantras,</em> and he shot arrows up and down to guard the maternity home from all directions.

He first of all went to the planet known as Yamaloka, where the superintendent of death, Yamarāja, lives. There he searched for the <em>brāhmaṇa’s</em> baby, but was unable to find him. He then immediately went to the planet where the king of heaven, Indra, lives. When unable to find the baby there, he went to the planet of the fire demigod, then to the planet of the Nirṛti demigod, and then to the moon planet. Then he went to Vāyuloka and Varuṇaloka.

When he was unable to find the baby even after searching all possible planets, he then attempted to throw himself into a fire, since he had promised the <em>brāhmaṇa</em> he would do so if unable to bring back his baby. Lord Kṛṣṇa, however, was very kind toward Arjuna because Arjuna was the most intimate friend of the Lord. Lord Kṛṣṇa persuaded Arjuna not to enter the fire in disgrace. Kṛṣṇa indicated that since Arjuna was His friend, if he were to enter the fire in hopelessness, indirectly it would be a blemish on Him. Lord Kṛṣṇa therefore checked Arjuna, assuring him that He would find the baby. He told Arjuna, “Do not foolishly commit suicide.”</div></div><div id="bb92740" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">After addressing Arjuna in this way, Lord Kṛṣṇa called for His transcendental chariot. He mounted it along with Arjuna and began to proceed north. Lord Kṛṣṇa, the all-powerful Personality of Godhead, could have brought the child back without effort, but we should always remember that He was playing the part of a human being. As a human being has to endeavor to achieve certain results, so Lord Kṛṣṇa, like an ordinary human being, or like His friend Arjuna, left Dvārakā to bring back the <em>brāhmaṇa’s</em> baby. By appearing in human society and exhibiting His pastimes as a human being, Kṛṣṇa definitely showed that there was not a single personality greater than He. “God is great.” That is the definition of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So at least within this material world, while He was present, Kṛṣṇa proved that there was no greater personality within the universe.</div></div><div id="bb92741" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Seated on His chariot with Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa proceeded north, crossing over many planetary systems. These are described in <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> as <em>sapta-dvīpa. Dvīpa</em> means “island.” These planets are sometimes described in the Vedic literature as <em>dvīpas.</em> The planet on which we are living is called Jambūdvīpa. Outer space is taken as a great ocean of air, and within that great ocean of air there are many islands, which are the different planets. On each and every planet there are oceans also. On some of the planets the oceans are of salt water, and on some of them there are oceans of milk. On others there are oceans of liquor, and on others there are oceans of ghee or oil. There are different kinds of mountains also. Each and every planet has a different type of atmosphere.</div></div><div id="bb92742" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Kṛṣṇa passed over all these planets and reached the covering of the universe. This covering is described in <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> as great darkness. The material world as a whole is described as dark. In the open space there is sunlight, and therefore it is illuminated, but in the covering, because of the absence of sunlight, it is naturally dark. When Kṛṣṇa approached the covering layer of this universe, the four horses which were drawing His chariot – Śaibya, Sugrīva, Meghapuṣpa and Balāhaka – all hesitated to enter the darkness. This hesitation is also a part of the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa because the horses of Kṛṣṇa are not ordinary; it is not possible for ordinary horses to go all over the universe and then enter into its outer covering layers. As Kṛṣṇa is transcendental, His chariot and His horses and everything else about Him are also transcendental, beyond the qualities of this material world. We should always remember that Kṛṣṇa was playing the part of an ordinary human being, and His horses also, by the will of Kṛṣṇa, played the parts of ordinary horses in hesitating to enter the darkness.</div></div><div id="bb92743" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Kṛṣṇa is known as Yogeśvara, as stated in the last portion of the <em>Bhagavad-gītā. Yogeśvaro hariḥ:</em> all mystic powers are under His control. In our experience we can see many human beings who have yogic mystic power and who sometimes perform very wonderful acts, but Kṛṣṇa is understood to be the master of all mystic power. Therefore, when He saw that His horses were hesitant to proceed into the darkness, He immediately released His disc, known as the Sudarśana <em>cakra,</em> which illuminated the sky a thousand times brighter than sunlight. The darkness of the covering of the universe is also a creation of Kṛṣṇa’s, and the Sudarśana <em>cakra</em> is Kṛṣṇa’s constant companion. Thus He penetrated the darkness by keeping the Sudarśana <em>cakra</em> before Him. <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> states that the Sudarśana <em>cakra</em> penetrated the darkness just as an arrow released from the Śārṅga bow of Lord Rāmacandra penetrated the army of Rāvaṇa. <em>Su</em> means “very nice,” and <em>darśana</em> means “observation”; by the grace of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s disc, Sudarśana, everything can be seen very nicely, and nothing can remain in darkness. Thus Lord Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna crossed over the great region of darkness covering the material universes.</div></div><div id="bb92744" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Arjuna then saw the effulgence of light known as the <em>brahma-jyotir.</em> The <em>brahma-jyotir</em> is situated outside the covering of the material universes, and because it cannot be seen with our present eyes, this <em>brahma-jyotir</em> is sometimes called <em>avyakta.</em> This spiritual effulgence is the ultimate destination of the impersonalists known as Vedāntists. The <em>brahma-jyotir</em> is also described as <em>ananta-pāram,</em> unlimited and unfathomed. When Lord Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna reached this region of the <em>brahma-jyotir,</em> Arjuna could not tolerate the glaring effulgence, and he closed his eyes. Lord Kṛṣṇa’s and Arjuna’s reaching the <em>brahma-jyotir</em> region is described in the <em>Hari-vaṁśa.</em> In that portion of the Vedic literature, Kṛṣṇa informs Arjuna, “My dear Arjuna, the glaring effulgence, the transcendental light you are seeing, is My bodily rays. O chief of the descendants of Bharata, this <em>brahma-jyotir</em> is I Myself.” As the sun disc and the sunshine cannot be separated, Kṛṣṇa and His bodily rays, the <em>brahma-jyotir,</em> cannot be separated. Thus Kṛṣṇa claims that the <em>brahma-jyotir</em> is He Himself. This is clearly stated in the <em>Hari-vaṁśa,</em> when Kṛṣṇa says <em>ahaṁ saḥ.</em> The <em>brahma-jyotir</em> is a combination of the minute particles known as spiritual sparks, or the living entities, known as <em>cit-kaṇa.</em> The Vedic words <em>so ’ham,</em> or “I am the <em>brahma-jyotir,</em>” can also be applied to the living entities, who can also claim to belong to the <em>brahma-jyotir.</em> In the <em>Hari-vaṁśa,</em> Kṛṣṇa further explains, “This <em>brahma-jyotir</em> is an expansion of My spiritual energy.”</div></div><div id="bb92745" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Kṛṣṇa told Arjuna, “The <em>brahma-jyotir</em> is beyond the region of My external energy, known as <em>māyā-śakti.</em>” When one is situated within the material world, it is not possible to experience this Brahman effulgence. In other words, in the material world this effulgence is not manifested, whereas in the spiritual world it is manifested. That is the purport of the words <em>vyakta-avyakta</em> in the <em>Hari-vaṁśa.</em> In the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> it is said, <em>avyakto ’vyaktāt sanātanaḥ:</em> both these energies are eternally manifested.</div></div><div id="bb92746" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">After this, Lord Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna entered a vast spiritual water. This spiritual water is called the Kāraṇa Ocean, which means that this ocean is the origin of the creation of the material world; this place is also known as Virajā, because it is free from the influence of the three qualities of the material world. In the <em>Mṛtyuñjaya-tantra,</em> a Vedic literature, there is a vivid description of this Kāraṇa Ocean, or Virajā. It is stated there that the highest planetary system within the material world is Satyaloka, or Brahmaloka, beyond which are Rudraloka and Mahā-viṣṇuloka. Regarding this Mahā-viṣṇuloka, it is stated in the <em>Brahma-saṁhitā, yaḥ kāraṇārṇava-jale bhajati sma yoga-nidrām ananta-jagad-aṇḍa-sa-roma-kūpaḥ:</em> “Lord Mahā-viṣṇu is lying in the Kāraṇa Ocean. When He exhales, innumerable universes come into existence, and when He inhales, innumerable universes enter within Him.” In this way, the material creation is generated and again withdrawn. When Lord Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna entered the water, it appeared that there was a strong hurricane of transcendental effulgence blowing, and the water of the Kāraṇa Ocean was greatly agitated. By the grace of Lord Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna had the unique experience of being able to see the very beautiful Kāraṇa Ocean.</div></div><div id="bb92747" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Accompanied by Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna saw a large palace within the water. There were many thousands of pillars and columns made of valuable jewels, and the glaring effulgence of those columns was so beautiful that Arjuna was charmed by it. Within that palace, Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa saw the gigantic form of Anantadeva, who is also known as Śeṣa. Lord Anantadeva, or Śeṣa Nāga, was in the form of a great serpent with thousands of hoods, each one decorated with valuable, effulgent jewels, beautifully dazzling. Each of Anantadeva’s hoods had two eyes, which appeared very fearful. His body was as white as the mountaintop of Kailāsa, which is always covered with snow. His necks were bluish, as were His tongues. Thus Arjuna saw the Śeṣa Nāga form, and he also saw that on the very soft, white body of Śeṣa Nāga, Lord Mahā-viṣṇu was lying very comfortably. He appeared all-pervading and very powerful, and Arjuna could understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead in that form is known as Puruṣottama. He is known as Puruṣottama, the supreme or best Personality of Godhead, because from this form emanates within the material world another form of Viṣṇu, known as Garbhodaka-śāyī Viṣṇu. The Mahā-viṣṇu form of the Lord is also called Puruṣottama (Puruṣa-uttama) because He is beyond the material world. <em>Tama</em> means “darkness,” and <em>ut</em> means “above, transcendental”; therefore, <em>uttama</em> means “above the darkest region of the material world.” Arjuna saw that the bodily color of Puruṣottama, Mahā-viṣṇu, was as dark as a new cloud in the rainy season. He was dressed in very nice yellow clothing, His face was beautifully smiling, and His eyes, which were like lotus petals, were very attractive. Lord Mahā-viṣṇu’s helmet was bedecked with valuable jewels, and His beautiful earrings enhanced the beauty of the curling hair on His head. Lord Mahā-viṣṇu had eight arms, all very long, reaching to His knees. His neck was decorated with the Kaustubha jewel, and His chest was marked with the symbol of Śrīvatsa, which means “the resting place of the goddess of fortune.” The Lord wore a garland of lotus flowers down to His knees. This long garland is known as a Vaijayantī garland.</div></div><div id="bb92748" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The Lord was attended by His personal associates Nanda and Sunanda, and the personified Sudarśana disc was also standing by Him. As stated in the <em>Vedas,</em> the Lord has innumerable energies, and they also stood there in their personified forms. The most important among them were as follows: Puṣṭi, the energy for nourishment; Śrī, the energy of beauty; Kīrti, the energy of reputation; and Ajā, the energy of material creation. All these energies are invested in the administrators of the material world, namely Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva and Lord Viṣṇu, and also in Indra (the king of the heavenly planets), Candra, Varuṇa and the sun god. In other words, all these demigods, being empowered by the Lord with certain energies, engage in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Mahā-viṣṇu feature is an expansion of Kṛṣṇa’s body. The <em>Brahma-saṁhitā</em> confirms that Mahā-viṣṇu is a portion of a plenary expansion of Kṛṣṇa. All such expansions are nondifferent from the Personality of Godhead, but since Kṛṣṇa appeared within this material world to manifest His pastimes as a human being, He and Arjuna immediately offered their respects to Lord Mahā-viṣṇu by bowing down before Him. It is stated in <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> that Lord Kṛṣṇa offered respect to Mahā-viṣṇu; this means that Kṛṣṇa offered obeisances unto none other than Himself, because Lord Mahā-viṣṇu is nondifferent from Kṛṣṇa Himself. This offering of obeisances by Kṛṣṇa to Mahā-viṣṇu is not, however, the form of worship known as <em>ahaṅgrahopāsanā,</em> which is sometimes recommended for persons trying to elevate themselves to the spiritual world by performing the sacrifice of knowledge. Such persons are also mentioned in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā: jñāna-yajñena cāpy anye yajanto mām upāsate.</em></div></div><div id="bb92749" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Although there was no necessity for Kṛṣṇa to offer obeisances, because He is the master teacher He taught Arjuna just how respect should be offered to Lord Mahā-viṣṇu. Arjuna, however, became very much afraid upon seeing the gigantic form of everything, distinct from the material experience. Seeing Kṛṣṇa offering obeisances to Lord Mahā-viṣṇu, he immediately followed Him and then stood before the Lord with folded hands. After this, the gigantic form of Mahā-viṣṇu, greatly pleased, smiled pleasingly and spoke as follows.</div></div><div id="bb92750" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">“My dear Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, I was very eager to see you both, and therefore I arranged to take away the babies of the<em> brāhmaṇa</em> and keep them here.

Now, after killing all these unwanted demons, you will please come back to Me. The two of you are incarnations of the great sage Nara-Nārāyaṇa. Although you are both complete in yourselves, to protect the devotees and to annihilate the demons, and especially to establish religious principles in the world so that peace and tranquillity may continue, you are teaching the basic principles of factual religion so that the people of the world may follow you and thereby be peaceful and prosperous.”</div></div><div id="bb92751" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Lord Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna then offered their obeisances to Lord Mahā-viṣṇu, and, taking back the <em>brāhmaṇa’s</em> children, they returned to Dvārakā via the same route by which they had entered the spiritual world.

After returning to Dvārakā, Lord Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna delivered to the <em>brāhmaṇa</em> all of his sons.</div></div><div id="bb92752" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Arjuna, however, was struck with great wonder after visiting the transcendental world by the grace of Lord Kṛṣṇa. And by the grace of Kṛṣṇa he could understand that whatever opulence there may be within this material world is an emanation from Him. Any opulent position a person may have within this material world is due to Kṛṣṇa’s mercy. One should therefore always be in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, in complete gratefulness to Lord Kṛṣṇa, because whatever one may possess is all bestowed by Him.</div></div><div id="bb92753" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Arjuna’s wonderful experience due to the mercy of Kṛṣṇa is one of the many thousands of pastimes performed by Lord Kṛṣṇa during His stay in this material world. They were all unique and have no parallel in the history of the world. All these pastimes prove fully that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Yet while present within this material world He played just like an ordinary man with many worldly duties. He played the part of an ideal householder possessing more than 16,000 wives, 16,000 palaces and 160,000 children, and in that role He performed many sacrifices just to teach the royal order how to live in the material world for the welfare of humanity. As the ideal Supreme Personality, He fulfilled the desires of everyone, from the <em>brāhmaṇas,</em> the highest persons in human society, down to the ordinary living entities, including the lowest of men. Just as King Indra is in charge of distributing rain all over the world to satisfy everyone in due course, so Lord Kṛṣṇa satisfies everyone by pouring down His causeless mercy. His mission was to give protection to the devotees and to kill the demoniac kings. Therefore He killed many hundreds and thousands of demons. Some of them He killed personally, and some were killed by Arjuna, who was deputed by Kṛṣṇa. In this way He established many pious kings such as Yudhiṣṭhira at the helm of world affairs. Thus, by His divine arrangement, He created the good government of King Yudhiṣṭhira, and there ensued peace and tranquillity.</div></div><div id="bb92754" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify italic"><em>Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the eighty-ninth chapter of</em> Kṛṣṇa, <em>“The Superexcellent Power of Kṛṣṇa.”</em></div></div><div class="mt-10 flex justify-between"><a href="/en/library/kb/88/" class="inline-flex font-sans items-center px-4 py-2 mr-4 text-base font-medium bg-vb-header-top bg-opacity-30 border border-vb-header-top border-opacity-30 rounded-lg hover:bg-opacity-50"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 448 512" class="mr-2" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M257.5 445.1l-22.2 22.2c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0L7 273c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9L201.4 44.7c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0l22.2 22.2c9.5 9.5 9.3 25-.4 34.3L136.6 216H424c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24v32c0 13.3-10.7 24-24 24H136.6l120.5 114.8c9.8 9.3 10 24.8.4 34.3z"></path></svg>CHAPTER 88</a><a href="/en/library/kb/90/" class="inline-flex font-sans items-center px-4 py-2 text-base font-medium bg-vb-header-top bg-opacity-30 border border-vb-header-top border-opacity-30 rounded-lg hover:bg-opacity-50">CHAPTER 90<svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 448 512" class="ml-2" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M190.5 66.9l22.2-22.2c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0L441 239c9.4 9.4 9.4 24.6 0 33.9L246.6 467.3c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0l-22.2-22.2c-9.5-9.5-9.3-25 .4-34.3L311.4 296H24c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24v-32c0-13.3 10.7-24 24-24h287.4L190.9 101.2c-9.8-9.3-10-24.8-.4-34.3z"></path></svg></a></div></main></div><div id="footer" class="mt-auto pt-3 mb-6 text-sm text-vb-normal-text/80 text-center"><div class="px-4 py-4 w-full max-w-screen-xl mx-auto md:px-8 text-sm text-vb-normal-text/80"><div class="py-2 px-3 border border-dashed border-vb-normal-text/15 text-justify relative "><a href="/en/donate/" class="z-20 float-right my-2 ml-3 w-auto border border-vb-action-border bg-vb-action-bg hover:bg-vb-action-bg/80 rounded-md text-vb-action-text py-3 px-6 text-center disabled:opacity-50">Donate</a><span class="flex-grow">Thanks to <span>Vinod Bapat and Meenal Bapat; Mahavisnupriya dasi &amp; Gostavihari das;   Kuldip Persaud; Gagan Kangovi; Rajendra and Geeta Ramchandani; NIOS - North American Institute for Oriental and Classical Studies; Jaykumar Prabhakar; Anantha SriSimha das, Spore; Bharat Vyas; HG Lakshmipati Narayan Das; HG Ragatmika Gopika Devi Dasi; Shri Chander Mohan Gilhotra; HG Prashant Mukund Das; Shri Trilok Singh Grover; Aneesh Koppula; Ronak Talati; Bhargav Ashok; J.K Ahuja; Akiralali; Radhapati Das; Bimal Gupta; Rajasa das; Aishwarya Balaraj; Yogendra Sharad Puranik; Riya and Tejal Chopade; Devarajula Pradeep Kumar (Saroornagar, Hyderabad); Late Chetana Dilip Bhatt; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/indradyumna-swami">Indradyumna Swami</a>; Sachin; Geetanjali Nath; Mario; Joeie; Susheela and Rama Krishna Reddy Patlolla; Jai Devaki Parks; Ashmi Chakraborty; Hari-kirtana das; Ramesta das; Prasad Buddhavarapu; dasa; Kresna Sucandra; Late Mr. S.

The three deities are the controllers of the three material qualities, namely the qualities of goodness, passion and ignorance. The plan decided upon by the sages was for Bhṛgu to test which one of the predominating deities possesses the quality of goodness in full. Therefore, when Bhṛgu Muni reached his father, Lord Brahmā, because Bhṛgu wanted to test whether Brahmā had the qu"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"ality of goodness, he purposely did not offer his respects to his father, either by offering obeisances or by offering prayers. It is the duty of a son or a disciple to offer respects and recite suitable prayers when he approaches his father or spiritual master. But Bhṛgu Muni purposely failed to offer respects, just to see Lord Brahmā’s reaction to this negligence. Lord Brahmā was very angry at his son’s impudence, and he showed signs which definitely proved this to be so. He was even prepared to condemn Bhṛgu by cursing him, but because Bhṛgu was his son, Lord Brahmā controlled his anger with his great intelligence. This means that although the quality of passion was prominent in Lord Brahmā, he had the power to control it. Lord Brahmā’s anger and his controlling his anger are likened to fire and water. Water is produced from fire at the beginning of creation, but fire can be extinguished with water. Similarly, although Lord Brahmā was very angry due to his quality of passion, he could still control his passion because Bhṛgu Muni was his son.2e:T787,After being saved from the anger of Lord Śiva, Bhṛgu Muni went directly to the planet Śvetadvīpa, where Lord Viṣṇu was lying on a bed of flowers in the company of His wife, the goddess of fortune, who was engaged in massaging His lotus feet. There Bhṛgu Muni purposely committed the greatest sin by offending Lord Viṣṇu by his bodily activities. The first offense committed by Bhṛgu Muni was mental, the second offense was vocal, and the third offense was corporal. These different offenses are progressively greater in degree. An offense committed within the mind is a positive offense, the same offense committed verbally is comparatively more grave, and when committed by bodily action it is superlative in offensiveness. So Bhṛgu Muni committed the greatest offense by kicking the chest of the Lord in the presence of the goddess of fortune. Of course, Lord Viṣṇu is all-merciful. He did not become angry at the activities of Bhṛgu"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1," Muni, for Bhṛgu Muni was a great \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa.\u003c/em\u003e A \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa\u003c/em\u003e is to be excused even if he sometimes commits an offense, and Lord Viṣṇu set the example. Yet it is said that from the time of this incident the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, has not been very favorably disposed toward the \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇas,\u003c/em\u003e and therefore, because the goddess of fortune withholds her benedictions from them, the \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇas\u003c/em\u003e are generally very poor. Bhṛgu Muni’s kicking the chest of Lord Viṣṇu  was certainly a great offense, but Lord Viṣṇu is so great that He did not care. The so-called \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇas\u003c/em\u003e of the Kali-yuga are sometimes very proud that a great \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa\u003c/em\u003e like Bhṛgu Muni could touch the chest of Lord Viṣṇu with his foot. But in fact when Bhṛgu Muni kicked the chest of Lord Viṣṇu it was the greatest offense, although Lord Viṣṇu, being greatly magnanimous, did not take it very seriously.2f:T450,Instead of being angry or cursing Bhṛgu Muni, Lord Viṣṇu immediately got up from His bed along with His wife, the goddess of fortune, and offered respectful obeisances to the \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa.\u003c/em\u003e He addressed Bhṛgu Muni as follows: “My dear \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa\u003c/em\u003e, it is My greatest fortune that you have come here. Please, therefore, sit down on this cushion for a few minutes. My dear \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa,\u003c/em\u003e I am very sorry that when you first entered My home I could not receive you properly. It was a great offense on My part, and I beg you to pardon Me. You are so pure and great that the water which washes your feet can purify even the places of pilgrimage. Therefore, I request you to purify the Vaikuṇṭha planet where I live with My associates. My dear Father, O great sage, I know that your feet are very soft, like a lotus flower, and that My chest is as hard as a thunderbolt. I am therefore afraid that you may have felt some pain by kicking My chest. Let Me touch your feet to relieve the pain you have suffered.” Lord Viṣṇu then began to ma"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"ssage the feet of Bhṛgu Muni.30:T530,The Lord continued to address Bhṛgu Muni. “My dear lord,” He said, “My chest has now become sanctified because of the touch of your feet, and I am now assured that the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, will be very glad to live there perpetually.” Another name for Lakṣmī is Cañcalā, indicating that she does not stay in one place for a long time. Therefore, we see that a rich man’s family sometimes becomes poor after a few generations, and sometimes we see that a poor man’s family becomes very rich. Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune, is Cañcalā in this material world, whereas in the Vaikuṇṭha planets she eternally lives at the lotus feet of the Lord. Because Lakṣmī is famous as Cañcalā, Lord Nārāyaṇa indicated that she might not have been living perpetually by His chest, but because His chest had been touched by the feet of Bhṛgu Muni, it was now sanctified, and there was no chance that the goddess of fortune would leave. Bhṛgu Muni, however, could understand his position and that of the Lord, and he was struck with wonder at the behavior of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because of his gratitude, his voice choked up, and he was unable to reply to the words of the Lord. Tears glided from his eyes, and he could not say anything. He simply stood silently before the Lord.31:T87a,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"After testing Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva and Lord Viṣṇu, Bhṛgu Muni returned to the assembly of great sages on the bank of the river Sarasvatī and described his experience. After hearing him with great attention, the sages concluded that of all the predominating deities, Lord Viṣṇu is certainly the greatest. In \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e these great sages are described as \u003cem\u003ebrahma-vādinām.

It is said in \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e that after hearing the details from Bhṛgu Muni the sages were astonished because although Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva were immediately agitated, Lord Viṣṇu, in spite of being kicked by Bhṛgu Muni, was not agitated in the least. The example is given that small lamps may be agitated by a slight breeze, but the greatest lamp or the greatest illuminating source, the sun, is never moved, even by the greatest hurricane. One’s greatness has to be estimated by one’s ability to tolerate provoking situations. The sages gathered on the bank of the river Sarasvatī concluded that one who wants actual peace and freedom from all fear should take shelter of the lotus feet of Viṣṇu. Since Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva lost their peaceful attitude upon a slight provocation, how can they maintain the peace and tranquillity of their devotees? As for Lord Viṣṇu, however, it is stated in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e that anyone who accepts Lord Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa as the supreme friend attains the highest perfection of peaceful life."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"32:T4dc,The sages thus concluded that by following the principles of \u003cem\u003evaiṣṇava-dharma\u003c/em\u003e one becomes actually perfect, but that if one follows all the religious principles of a particular sect and does not become advanced in understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, all such labor of love is fruitless. To execute religious principles means to come to the platform of perfect knowledge. If one comes to the platform of perfect knowledge, then he will be uninterested in material affairs. Perfect knowledge means knowledge of one’s own self and the Supreme Self. The Supreme Self and the individual self, although one in quality, are different in quantity. This analytical understanding of knowledge is perfect. Simply to understand “I am not matter; I am spirit” is not perfect knowledge. The real religious principle is devotional service, or \u003cem\u003ebhakti.\u003c/em\u003e This is confirmed in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā,\u003c/em\u003e where Lord Kṛṣṇa says, “Give up all other religious principles and simply surrender unto Me.” Therefore, the term \u003cem\u003edharma\u003c/em\u003e applies only to \u003cem\u003evaiṣṇava-dharma,\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003ebhagavad-dharma,\u003c/em\u003e by following which one automatically achieves all good qualities and advancements in life.33:T66c,The highest perfectional knowledge is knowledge of the Supreme Lord. He cannot be understood by any process of religion other than devotional service; therefore, the immediate result of perfect knowledge is achieved by executing devotional service. After attainment of knowledge, one becomes uninterested in the material world. This is not because of dry philosophical speculation. The devotees become uninterested in the material world not simply because of theoretical understanding but because of practical experience. When a devotee realizes the effect of association with the Supreme Lord, he naturally hates the association of so-called society, friendship and love. This detachment is not dry but is due to achieving a higher status of life by relishing transcendental mellows. It "])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"is further stated in \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e that after attainment of such knowledge and such detachment from material sense gratification, one’s advancement in the eight opulences attained through mystic \u003cem\u003eyoga\u003c/em\u003e practice, such as the \u003cem\u003eaṇimā, laghimā\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eprāpti siddhis,\u003c/em\u003e is also achieved without separate effort.

In other words, a devotee does not need to practice the mystic \u003cem\u003eyoga\u003c/em\u003e system to achieve power. The power is behind him by the grace of the Lord, just as when a small child is surrendered to a powerful father, all the powers of the father are behind him.34:T96d,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"When a person becomes famous as a devotee of the Lord, his reputation is never to be extinguished. Lord Caitanya, when discoursing with Rāmānanda Rāya, questioned, “What is the greatest fame?” Rāmānanda Rāya replied that to be known as a pure devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa is the perfect fame. The conclusion, therefore, is that \u003cem\u003e viṣṇu-dharma,\u003c/em\u003e or the religion of devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is meant for persons who are thoughtful. By proper utilization of thoughtfulness, one comes to the stage of thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one becomes free from the contamination of the faulty association of the material world, and thus one becomes peaceful. The world is in a disturbed condition because of a scarcity of such peaceful devotees in human society. Unless one is a devotee, one cannot be equal to all living entities. A devotee is equally disposed toward the animals, the human beings and all living entities because he sees every living entity as a part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. In the \u003cem\u003eĪśopaniṣad\u003c/em\u003e it is clearly stated that one who has come to the stage of seeing all living beings equally does not hate anyone or favor anyone. The devotee does not hanker to possess more than he requires. Devotees are therefore \u003cem\u003eakiñcana:\u003c/em\u003e in any condition of life a devotee is satisfied. It is said that a devotee is even-minded whether he is in hell or in heaven. A devotee is callous to all subjects other than his engagement in devotional service. This mode of life is the highest perfectional stage, from which one can be elevated to the spiritual world, back home, back to Godhead. The devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are especially attracted by the highest material quality, goodness, and the qualified \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa\u003c/em\u003e is the symbolic representation of this goodness. Therefore, a devotee is attached to the brahminical stage of life. He is not very interested in passion or ignorance, although these qualities also emanate from the Supreme Lord, Viṣṇu. In \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e the devotees are described as \u003cem\u003enipuṇa-buddhayaḥ,\u003c/em\u003e which means that they are the most intelligent class of men. Uninfluenced by attachment or hatred, the devotee lives very peacefully and is not agitated by the influence of passion and ignorance."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"35:T42b,Those who are actually eager to be liberated from material entanglement would do well to accept at once the conclusion given by Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī. In the beginning of \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,\u003c/em\u003e which is spoken by Śukadeva Gosvāmī, it is said that hearing \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e is extremely conducive to liberation. The same fact is now confirmed by Sūta Gosvāmī: if anyone who is traveling aimlessly within this material world cares to hear the nectarean words spoken by Śukadeva Gosvāmī, certainly he will come to the right conclusion, which is that simply by discharging devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead one will be able to stop the fatigue of perpetually migrating from one material body to another. In other words, one who becomes fixed in loving devotional service to Viṣṇu will certainly be able to get relief from this journey of material life, and the process is very simple: one has to give aural reception to the sweet words spoken by Śukadeva Gosvāmī in the form of \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.\u003c/em\u003e36:T472,Once upon a time in Dvārakā, a \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa’s\u003c/em\u003e wife gave birth to a child.

Formerly, when there were responsible kings, up to the time of Dvāpara-yuga, when Lord Kṛṣṇa was present, the king was liable to be blamed for the untimely death of a child in the presence of his parents. Similarly, such responsibility was there during the time of Lord Rāmacandra. As we have explained in the First Canto of \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,\u003c/em\u003e the king was so responsible for the comforts of the citizens that he was to see that there was not even excessive heat or cold.

Do you think that all the royal personalities in this country simply engage in performing sacrifices with the \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇas\u003c/em\u003e but have no chivalrous power?” Thus Arjuna indicated that \u003cem\u003ekṣatriyas\u003c/em\u003e should not sit back comfortably on the pretext of performing Vedic rituals but must rather be very chivalrous in protecting the citizens. \u003cem\u003eBrāhmaṇas,\u003c/em\u003e being engaged in spiritual activities, are not expected to do anything which requires physical endeavor. Therefore, they need to be protected by the \u003cem\u003ekṣatriyas\u003c/em\u003e so that they will not be disturbed in the execution of their higher occupational duties.38:T607,Arjuna, who apparently had not left Dvārakā because he had to fulfill his promise to the \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa,\u003c/em\u003e was called at night when the \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa’s\u003c/em\u003e wife was to give birth to the child.

Lord Kṛṣṇa, however, was very kind toward Arjuna because Arjuna was the most intimate friend of the Lord. Lord Kṛṣṇa persuaded Arjuna not to enter the fire in disgrace. Kṛṣṇa indicated that since Arjuna was His friend, if he were to enter the fire in hopelessness, indirectly it would be a blemish on Him. Lord Kṛṣṇa therefore checked Arjuna, assuring him that He would find the baby. He told Arjuna, “Do not foolishly commit suicide.”3a:T498,Kṛṣṇa passed over all these planets and reached the covering of the universe. This covering is described in \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e as great darkness. The material world as a whole is described as dark. In the open space there is sunlight, and therefore it is illuminated, but in the covering, because of the absence of sunlight, it is naturally dark. When Kṛṣṇa approached the covering layer of this universe, the four horses which were drawing His chariot – Śaibya, Sugrīva, Meghapuṣpa and Balāhaka – all hesitated to enter the darkness. This hesitation is also a part of the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa because the horses of Kṛṣṇa are not ordinary; it is not possible for ordinary horses to go all over the universe and then enter into its outer covering layers. As Kṛṣṇa is transcendental, His chariot and His horses and everything else about Him are also transcendental, beyond the qualities of this material world.

Thus He penetrated the darkness by keeping the Sudarśana \u003cem\u003ecakra\u003c/em\u003e before Him. \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e states that the Sudarśana \u003cem\u003ecakra\u003c/em\u003e penetrated the darkness just as an arrow released from the Śārṅga bow of Lord Rāmacandra penetrated the army of Rāvaṇa. \u003cem\u003eSu\u003c/em\u003e means “very nice,” and \u003cem\u003edarśana\u003c/em\u003e means “observation”; by the grace of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s disc, Sudarśana, everything can be seen very nicely, and nothing can remain in darkness.

This spiritual water is called the Kāraṇa Ocean, which means that this ocean is the origin of the creation of the material world; this place is also known as Virajā, because it is free from the influence of the three qualities of the material world. In the \u003cem\u003eMṛtyuñjaya-tantra,\u003c/em\u003e a Vedic literature, there is a vivid description of this Kāraṇa Ocean, or Virajā.

There were many thousands of pillars and columns made of valuable jewels, and the glaring effulgence of those columns was so beautiful that Arjuna was charmed by it. Within that palace, Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa saw the gigantic form of Anantadeva, who is also known as Śeṣa. Lord Anantadeva, or Śeṣa Nāga, was in the form of a great serpent with thousands of hoods, each one decorated with valuable, effulgent jewels, beautifully dazzling. Each of Anantadeva’s hoods had two eyes, which appeared very fearful. His body was as white as the mountaintop of Kailāsa, which is always covered with snow. His necks were bluish, as were His tongues. Thus Arjuna saw the Śeṣa Nāga form, and he also saw that on the very soft, white body of Śeṣa Nāga, Lord Mahā-viṣṇu was lying very comfortably. He appeared all-pervading and very powerful, and Arjuna could understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead in that form is known as Puruṣottama. He is known as Puruṣottama, the supreme or best Personality of Godhead, because from this form emanates within the material world another form of Viṣṇu, known as Garbhodaka-śāyī Viṣṇu. The Mahā-viṣṇu form of the Lord is also called Puruṣottama (Puruṣa-uttama) because He is beyond the material world. \u003cem\u003eTama\u003c/em\u003e means “darkness,” and \u003cem\u003eut\u003c/em\u003e means “above, transcendental”; therefore, \u003cem\u003euttama\u003c/em\u003e means “above the darkest region of the material world.” Arjuna saw that the bodily color of Puruṣottama, Mahā-viṣṇu, was as dark as a new cloud in the rainy season.

Lord Mahā-viṣṇu’s helmet was bedecked with valuable jewels, and His beautiful earrings enhanced the beauty of the curling hair on His head. Lord Mahā-viṣṇu had eight arms, all very long, reaching to His knees. His neck was decorated with the Kaustubha jewel, and His chest was marked with the symbol of Śrīvatsa, which means “the resting place of the goddess of fortune.” The Lord wore a garland of lotus flowers down to His knees.

The most important among them were as follows: Puṣṭi, the energy for nourishment; Śrī, the energy of beauty; Kīrti, the energy of reputation; and Ajā, the energy of material creation. All these energies are invested in the administrators of the material world, namely Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva and Lord Viṣṇu, and also in Indra (the king of the heavenly planets), Candra, Varuṇa and the sun god. In other words, all these demigods, being empowered by the Lord with certain energies, engage in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Mahā-viṣṇu feature is an expansion of Kṛṣṇa’s body. The \u003cem\u003eBrahma-saṁhitā\u003c/em\u003e confirms that Mahā-viṣṇu is a portion of a plenary expansion of Kṛṣṇa. All such expansions are nondifferent from the Personality of Godhead, but since Kṛṣṇa appeared within this material world to manifest His pastimes as a human being, He and Arjuna immediately offered their respects to Lord Mahā-viṣṇu by bowing down before Him. It is stated in \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e that Lord Kṛṣṇa offered respect to Mahā-viṣṇu; this means that Kṛṣṇa offered obeisances unto none other than Himself, because Lord Mahā-viṣṇu is nondifferent from Kṛṣṇa Himself.

They were all unique and have no parallel in the history of the world. All these pastimes prove fully that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Yet while present within this material world He played just like an ordinary man with many worldly duties. He played the part of an ideal householder possessing more than 16,000 wives, 16,000 palaces and 160,000 children, and in that role He performed many sacrifices just to teach the royal order how to live in the material world for the welfare of humanity. As the ideal Supreme Personality, He fulfilled the desires of everyone, from the \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇas,\u003c/em\u003e the highest persons in human society, down to the ordinary living entities, including the lowest of men. Just as King Indra is in charge of distributing rain all over the world to satisfy everyone in due course, so Lord Kṛṣṇa satisfies everyone by pouring down His causeless mercy. His mission was to give protection to the devotees and to kill the demoniac kings. Therefore He killed many hundreds and thousands of demons. Some of them He killed personally, and some were killed by Arjuna, who was deputed by Kṛṣṇa. In this way He established many pious kings such as Yudhiṣṭhira at the helm of world affairs. Thus, by His divine arrangement, He created the good government of King Yudhiṣṭhira, and there ensued peace and tranquillity.43:T62a,Being thus deputed, the great sage Bhṛgu Muni first of all went to his father’s residence in Brahmaloka. The three deities are the controllers of the three material qualities, namely the qualities of goodness, passion and ignorance. The plan decided upon by the sages was for Bhṛgu to test which one of the predominating deities possesses the quality of goodness in full. Therefore, when Bhṛgu Muni reached his father, Lord Brahmā, because Bhṛgu wanted to test whether Brahmā had the quality of goodness, he purposely did not offer his respects to his father, either by offering o"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"beisances or by offering prayers. It is the duty of a son or a disciple to offer respects and recite suitable prayers when he approaches his father or spiritual master. But Bhṛgu Muni purposely failed to offer respects, just to see Lord Brahmā’s reaction to this negligence. Lord Brahmā was very angry at his son’s impudence, and he showed signs which definitely proved this to be so. He was even prepared to condemn Bhṛgu by cursing him, but because Bhṛgu was his son, Lord Brahmā controlled his anger with his great intelligence. This means that although the quality of passion was prominent in Lord Brahmā, he had the power to control it. Lord Brahmā’s anger and his controlling his anger are likened to fire and water. Water is produced from fire at the beginning of creation, but fire can be extinguished with water. Similarly, although Lord Brahmā was very angry due to his quality of passion, he could still control his passion because Bhṛgu Muni was his son.44:T787,After being saved from the anger of Lord Śiva, Bhṛgu Muni went directly to the planet Śvetadvīpa, where Lord Viṣṇu was lying on a bed of flowers in the company of His wife, the goddess of fortune, who was engaged in massaging His lotus feet. There Bhṛgu Muni purposely committed the greatest sin by offending Lord Viṣṇu by his bodily activities. The first offense committed by Bhṛgu Muni was mental, the second offense was vocal, and the third offense was corporal. These different offenses are progressively greater in degree. An offense committed within the mind is a positive offense, the same offense committed verbally is comparatively more grave, and when committed by bodily action it is superlative in offensiveness. So Bhṛgu Muni committed the greatest offense by kicking the chest of the Lord in the presence of the goddess of fortune. Of course, Lord Viṣṇu is all-merciful. He did not become angry at the activities of Bhṛgu Muni, for Bhṛgu Muni was a great \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa.\u003c/em\u003e A \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa\u003c/em\u003e is to be excu"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"sed even if he sometimes commits an offense, and Lord Viṣṇu set the example. Yet it is said that from the time of this incident the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, has not been very favorably disposed toward the \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇas,\u003c/em\u003e and therefore, because the goddess of fortune withholds her benedictions from them, the \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇas\u003c/em\u003e are generally very poor. Bhṛgu Muni’s kicking the chest of Lord Viṣṇu  was certainly a great offense, but Lord Viṣṇu is so great that He did not care. The so-called \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇas\u003c/em\u003e of the Kali-yuga are sometimes very proud that a great \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa\u003c/em\u003e like Bhṛgu Muni could touch the chest of Lord Viṣṇu with his foot. But in fact when Bhṛgu Muni kicked the chest of Lord Viṣṇu it was the greatest offense, although Lord Viṣṇu, being greatly magnanimous, did not take it very seriously.45:T450,Instead of being angry or cursing Bhṛgu Muni, Lord Viṣṇu immediately got up from His bed along with His wife, the goddess of fortune, and offered respectful obeisances to the \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa.\u003c/em\u003e He addressed Bhṛgu Muni as follows: “My dear \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa\u003c/em\u003e, it is My greatest fortune that you have come here. Please, therefore, sit down on this cushion for a few minutes. My dear \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa,\u003c/em\u003e I am very sorry that when you first entered My home I could not receive you properly. It was a great offense on My part, and I beg you to pardon Me. You are so pure and great that the water which washes your feet can purify even the places of pilgrimage. Therefore, I request you to purify the Vaikuṇṭha planet where I live with My associates. My dear Father, O great sage, I know that your feet are very soft, like a lotus flower, and that My chest is as hard as a thunderbolt. I am therefore afraid that you may have felt some pain by kicking My chest. Let Me touch your feet to relieve the pain you have suffered.” Lord Viṣṇu then began to massage the feet of Bhṛgu Muni.46:T530,The Lord continued to address Bhṛgu Muni. “My dear "])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"lord,” He said, “My chest has now become sanctified because of the touch of your feet, and I am now assured that the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, will be very glad to live there perpetually.” Another name for Lakṣmī is Cañcalā, indicating that she does not stay in one place for a long time. Therefore, we see that a rich man’s family sometimes becomes poor after a few generations, and sometimes we see that a poor man’s family becomes very rich. Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune, is Cañcalā in this material world, whereas in the Vaikuṇṭha planets she eternally lives at the lotus feet of the Lord. Because Lakṣmī is famous as Cañcalā, Lord Nārāyaṇa indicated that she might not have been living perpetually by His chest, but because His chest had been touched by the feet of Bhṛgu Muni, it was now sanctified, and there was no chance that the goddess of fortune would leave. Bhṛgu Muni, however, could understand his position and that of the Lord, and he was struck with wonder at the behavior of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because of his gratitude, his voice choked up, and he was unable to reply to the words of the Lord. Tears glided from his eyes, and he could not say anything. He simply stood silently before the Lord.47:T87a,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"After testing Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva and Lord Viṣṇu, Bhṛgu Muni returned to the assembly of great sages on the bank of the river Sarasvatī and described his experience. After hearing him with great attention, the sages concluded that of all the predominating deities, Lord Viṣṇu is certainly the greatest. In \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e these great sages are described as \u003cem\u003ebrahma-vādinām. Brahma-vādinām\u003c/em\u003e means those who talk about the Absolute Truth but have not yet come to a conclusion. Generally \u003cem\u003ebrahma-vādī\u003c/em\u003e refers to the impersonalists or to those who are students of the \u003cem\u003eVedas.\u003c/em\u003e It is to be understood, therefore, that all the gathered sages were serious students of the Vedic literature but had not come to a definite conclusion as to who is the Supreme Absolute Personality of Godhead. But after hearing of Bhṛgu Muni’s experience in meeting all three predominating deities – Lord Śiva, Lord Brahmā and Lord Viṣṇu – the sages concluded that Lord Viṣṇu is the Supreme Truth, the Personality of Godhead. It is said in \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e that after hearing the details from Bhṛgu Muni the sages were astonished because although Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva were immediately agitated, Lord Viṣṇu, in spite of being kicked by Bhṛgu Muni, was not agitated in the least. The example is given that small lamps may be agitated by a slight breeze, but the greatest lamp or the greatest illuminating source, the sun, is never moved, even by the greatest hurricane. One’s greatness has to be estimated by one’s ability to tolerate provoking situations. The sages gathered on the bank of the river Sarasvatī concluded that one who wants actual peace and freedom from all fear should take shelter of the lotus feet of Viṣṇu. Since Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva lost their peaceful attitude upon a slight provocation, how can they maintain the peace and tranquillity of their devotees? As for Lord Viṣṇu, however, it is stated in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e that anyone who accepts Lord Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa as the supreme friend attains the highest perfection of peaceful life."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"48:T4dc,The sages thus concluded that by following the principles of \u003cem\u003evaiṣṇava-dharma\u003c/em\u003e one becomes actually perfect, but that if one follows all the religious principles of a particular sect and does not become advanced in understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, all such labor of love is fruitless. To execute religious principles means to come to the platform of perfect knowledge. If one comes to the platform of perfect knowledge, then he will be uninterested in material affairs. Perfect knowledge means knowledge of one’s own self and the Supreme Self. The Supreme Self and the individual self, although one in quality, are different in quantity. This analytical understanding of knowledge is perfect. Simply to understand “I am not matter; I am spirit” is not perfect knowledge. The real religious principle is devotional service, or \u003cem\u003ebhakti.\u003c/em\u003e This is confirmed in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā,\u003c/em\u003e where Lord Kṛṣṇa says, “Give up all other religious principles and simply surrender unto Me.” Therefore, the term \u003cem\u003edharma\u003c/em\u003e applies only to \u003cem\u003evaiṣṇava-dharma,\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003ebhagavad-dharma,\u003c/em\u003e by following which one automatically achieves all good qualities and advancements in life.49:T66c,The highest perfectional knowledge is knowledge of the Supreme Lord. He cannot be understood by any process of religion other than devotional service; therefore, the immediate result of perfect knowledge is achieved by executing devotional service. After attainment of knowledge, one becomes uninterested in the material world. This is not because of dry philosophical speculation. The devotees become uninterested in the material world not simply because of theoretical understanding but because of practical experience. When a devotee realizes the effect of association with the Supreme Lord, he naturally hates the association of so-called society, friendship and love. This detachment is not dry but is due to achieving a higher status of life by relishing transcendental mellows. It "])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"is further stated in \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e that after attainment of such knowledge and such detachment from material sense gratification, one’s advancement in the eight opulences attained through mystic \u003cem\u003eyoga\u003c/em\u003e practice, such as the \u003cem\u003eaṇimā, laghimā\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eprāpti siddhis,\u003c/em\u003e is also achieved without separate effort. The perfect example is Mahārāja Ambarīṣa. He was not a mystic \u003cem\u003eyogī\u003c/em\u003e but a great devotee, yet in a disagreement with Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, the great mystic Durvāsā was defeated in the presence of the King’s devotional attitude. In other words, a devotee does not need to practice the mystic \u003cem\u003eyoga\u003c/em\u003e system to achieve power. The power is behind him by the grace of the Lord, just as when a small child is surrendered to a powerful father, all the powers of the father are behind him.4a:T96d,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"When a person becomes famous as a devotee of the Lord, his reputation is never to be extinguished. Lord Caitanya, when discoursing with Rāmānanda Rāya, questioned, “What is the greatest fame?” Rāmānanda Rāya replied that to be known as a pure devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa is the perfect fame. The conclusion, therefore, is that \u003cem\u003e viṣṇu-dharma,\u003c/em\u003e or the religion of devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is meant for persons who are thoughtful. By proper utilization of thoughtfulness, one comes to the stage of thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one becomes free from the contamination of the faulty association of the material world, and thus one becomes peaceful. The world is in a disturbed condition because of a scarcity of such peaceful devotees in human society. Unless one is a devotee, one cannot be equal to all living entities. A devotee is equally disposed toward the animals, the human beings and all living entities because he sees every living entity as a part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. In the \u003cem\u003eĪśopaniṣad\u003c/em\u003e it is clearly stated that one who has come to the stage of seeing all living beings equally does not hate anyone or favor anyone. The devotee does not hanker to possess more than he requires. Devotees are therefore \u003cem\u003eakiñcana:\u003c/em\u003e in any condition of life a devotee is satisfied. It is said that a devotee is even-minded whether he is in hell or in heaven. A devotee is callous to all subjects other than his engagement in devotional service. This mode of life is the highest perfectional stage, from which one can be elevated to the spiritual world, back home, back to Godhead. The devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are especially attracted by the highest material quality, goodness, and the qualified \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa\u003c/em\u003e is the symbolic representation of this goodness. Therefore, a devotee is attached to the brahminical stage of life. He is not very interested in passion or ignorance, although these qualities also emanate from the Supreme Lord, Viṣṇu. In \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e the devotees are described as \u003cem\u003enipuṇa-buddhayaḥ,\u003c/em\u003e which means that they are the most intelligent class of men.

The same fact is now confirmed by Sūta Gosvāmī: if anyone who is traveling aimlessly within this material world cares to hear the nectarean words spoken by Śukadeva Gosvāmī, certainly he will come to the right conclusion, which is that simply by discharging devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead one will be able to stop the fatigue of perpetually migrating from one material body to another. In other words, one who becomes fixed in loving devotional service to Viṣṇu will certainly be able to get relief from this journey of material life, and the process is very simple: one has to give aural reception to the sweet words spoken by Śukadeva Gosvāmī in the form of \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.\u003c/em\u003e4c:T472,Once upon a time in Dvārakā, a \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa’s\u003c/em\u003e wife gave birth to a child.

Formerly, when there were responsible kings, up to the time of Dvāpara-yuga, when Lord Kṛṣṇa was present, the king was liable to be blamed for the untimely death of a child in the presence of his parents. Similarly, such responsibility was there during the time of Lord Rāmacandra. As we have explained in the First Canto of \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,\u003c/em\u003e the king was so responsible for the comforts of the citizens that he was to see that there was not even excessive heat or cold.

Do you think that all the royal personalities in this country simply engage in performing sacrifices with the \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇas\u003c/em\u003e but have no chivalrous power?” Thus Arjuna indicated that \u003cem\u003ekṣatriyas\u003c/em\u003e should not sit back comfortably on the pretext of performing Vedic rituals but must rather be very chivalrous in protecting the citizens. \u003cem\u003eBrāhmaṇas,\u003c/em\u003e being engaged in spiritual activities, are not expected to do anything which requires physical endeavor.

Lord Kṛṣṇa, however, was very kind toward Arjuna because Arjuna was the most intimate friend of the Lord. Lord Kṛṣṇa persuaded Arjuna not to enter the fire in disgrace. Kṛṣṇa indicated that since Arjuna was His friend, if he were to enter the fire in hopelessness, indirectly it would be a blemish on Him. Lord Kṛṣṇa therefore checked Arjuna, assuring him that He would find the baby.

This covering is described in \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e as great darkness. The material world as a whole is described as dark.

When Kṛṣṇa approached the covering layer of this universe, the four horses which were drawing His chariot – Śaibya, Sugrīva, Meghapuṣpa and Balāhaka – all hesitated to enter the darkness. This hesitation is also a part of the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa because the horses of Kṛṣṇa are not ordinary; it is not possible for ordinary horses to go all over the universe and then enter into its outer covering layers. As Kṛṣṇa is transcendental, His chariot and His horses and everything else about Him are also transcendental, beyond the qualities of this material world.

This spiritual water is called the Kāraṇa Ocean, which means that this ocean is the origin of the creation of the material world; this place is also known as Virajā, because it is free from the influence of the three qualities of the material world. In the \u003cem\u003eMṛtyuñjaya-tantra,\u003c/em\u003e a Vedic literature, there is a vivid description of this Kāraṇa Ocean, or Virajā. It is stated there that the highest planetary system within the material world is Satyaloka, or Brahmaloka, beyond which are Rudraloka and Mahā-viṣṇuloka. Regarding this Mahā-viṣṇuloka, it is stated in the \u003cem\u003eBrahma-saṁhitā, yaḥ kāraṇārṇava-jale bhajati sma yoga-nidrām ananta-jagad-aṇḍa-sa-roma-kūpaḥ:\u003c/em\u003e “Lord Mahā-viṣṇu is lying in the Kāraṇa Ocean.

When Lord Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna entered the water, it appeared that there was a strong hurricane of transcendental effulgence blowing, and the water of the Kāraṇa Ocean was greatly agitated. By the grace of Lord Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna had the unique experience of being able to see the very beautiful Kāraṇa Ocean.54:T8f4,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Accompanied by Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna saw a large palace within the water. There were many thousands of pillars and columns made of valuable jewels, and the glaring effulgence of those columns was so beautiful that Arjuna was charmed by it. Within that palace, Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa saw the gigantic form of Anantadeva, who is also known as Śeṣa. Lord Anantadeva, or Śeṣa Nāga, was in the form of a great serpent with thousands of hoods, each one decorated with valuable, effulgent jewels, beautifully dazzling. Each of Anantadeva’s hoods had two eyes, which appeared very fearful. His body was as white as the mountaintop of Kailāsa, which is always covered with snow. His necks were bluish, as were His tongues. Thus Arjuna saw the Śeṣa Nāga form, and he also saw that on the very soft, white body of Śeṣa Nāga, Lord Mahā-viṣṇu was lying very comfortably. He appeared all-pervading and very powerful, and Arjuna could understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead in that form is known as Puruṣottama. He is known as Puruṣottama, the supreme or best Personality of Godhead, because from this form emanates within the material world another form of Viṣṇu, known as Garbhodaka-śāyī Viṣṇu. The Mahā-viṣṇu form of the Lord is also called Puruṣottama (Puruṣa-uttama) because He is beyond the material world. \u003cem\u003eTama\u003c/em\u003e means “darkness,” and \u003cem\u003eut\u003c/em\u003e means “above, transcendental”; therefore, \u003cem\u003euttama\u003c/em\u003e means “above the darkest region of the material world.” Arjuna saw that the bodily color of Puruṣottama, Mahā-viṣṇu, was as dark as a new cloud in the rainy season. He was dressed in very nice yellow clothing, His face was beautifully smiling, and His eyes, which were like lotus petals, were very attractive. Lord Mahā-viṣṇu’s helmet was bedecked with valuable jewels, and His beautiful earrings enhanced the beauty of the curling hair on His head. Lord Mahā-viṣṇu had eight arms, all very long, reaching to His knees. His neck was decorated with the Kaustubha jewel, and His chest was marked with the symbol of Śrīvatsa, which means “the resting place of the goddess of fortune.” The Lord wore a garland of lotus flowers down to His knees. This long garland is known as a Vaijayantī garland."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"55:T786,The Lord was attended by His personal associates Nanda and Sunanda, and the personified Sudarśana disc was also standing by Him. As stated in the \u003cem\u003eVedas,\u003c/em\u003e the Lord has innumerable energies, and they also stood there in their personified forms. The most important among them were as follows: Puṣṭi, the energy for nourishment; Śrī, the energy of beauty; Kīrti, the energy of reputation; and Ajā, the energy of material creation. All these energies are invested in the administrators of the material world, namely Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva and Lord Viṣṇu, and also in Indra (the king of the heavenly planets), Candra, Varuṇa and the sun god. In other words, all these demigods, being empowered by the Lord with certain energies, engage in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Mahā-viṣṇu feature is an expansion of Kṛṣṇa’s body. The \u003cem\u003eBrahma-saṁhitā\u003c/em\u003e confirms that Mahā-viṣṇu is a portion of a plenary expansion of Kṛṣṇa. All such expansions are nondifferent from the Personality of Godhead, but since Kṛṣṇa appeared within this material world to manifest His pastimes as a human being, He and Arjuna immediately offered their respects to Lord Mahā-viṣṇu by bowing down before Him. It is stated in \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e that Lord Kṛṣṇa offered respect to Mahā-viṣṇu; this means that Kṛṣṇa offered obeisances unto none other than Himself, because Lord Mahā-viṣṇu is nondifferent from Kṛṣṇa Himself.

He played the part of an ideal householder possessing more than 16,000 wives, 16,000 palaces and 160,000 children, and in that role He performed many sacrifices just to teach the royal order how to live in the material world for the welfare of humanity.

His mission was to give protection to the devotees and to kill the demoniac kings. Therefore He killed many hundreds and thousands of demons. Some of them He killed personally, and some were killed by Arjuna, who was deputed by Kṛṣṇa. In this way He established many pious kings such as Yudhiṣṭhira at the helm of world affairs.
