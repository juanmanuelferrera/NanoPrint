system renowned for its extraordinary power and the fact that it can be easily practiced almost anywhere and at any time. “If you take up this simple process,” he says, “chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma Hare Hare, you are immediately elevated to the transcendental platform.” He adds, “No other meditation is possible while you are walking

We are spreading this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement because there is a great need of this consciousness throughout the world. And the process is very easy – that is the advantage.</div></div><div id="bb94657" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">First of all, we must try to understand what the transcendental platform is. As far as our present condition is concerned, we are on various platforms. So we have to first of all stand on the transcendental platform; then there can be a question of transcendental meditation.</div></div><div id="bb94658" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the third chapter of <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>, you’ll find an explanation of the various statuses of conditioned life. The first is the bodily conception of life (<em>indriyāṇi parāṇy āhuḥ</em>). Everyone in this material world is under this bodily concept of life. Someone is thinking, “I am Indian.” You are thinking, “I am American.” Somebody’s thinking, “I am Russian.” Somebody’s thinking he is something else. So everyone is thinking, “I am the body.”</div></div><div id="bb94659" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">This bodily standard of conditioned life is called the sensual platform, because as long as we have a bodily conception of life we think happiness means sense gratification. That’s all. This bodily concept of life is very prominent at the present moment – not only at the present moment, but since the creation of this material world. That is the disease: “I am the body.”</div></div><div id="bb94660" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> says, <em>yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke:</em> Thinking we are the body means we have a concept of ourself as a bag of skin and bones. The body is a bag of skin, bones, blood, urine, stool, and so many other nice things. So when we think, “I am the body,” we are actually thinking, “I am a bag of bones and skin and stool and urine. That is my beauty; that is my everything.” So this bodily concept of life is not very intelligent, and improvement of the body is not a right calculation of self-realization.</div></div><div id="bb94661" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Those who are too engrossed with the bodily concept of life are recommended to practice the <em>dhyāna-yoga</em> system, the <em>yoga</em> of meditation. That is mentioned in the <em>Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā.</em> In the sixth chapter, verses 13 and 14, Kṛṣṇa explains, “One should hold one’s body, neck, and head erect in a straight line and stare steadily at the tip of the nose. Thus, with an unagitated, subdued mind, devoid of fear, completely free from sex life, one should meditate upon Me within the heart and make Me the ultimate goal of life.”</div></div><div id="bb94662" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Earlier Lord Kṛṣṇa gives preliminary instructions on how one should practice this transcendental meditation. One has to restrict sense gratification, especially sex. One has to select a very solitary place, a sacred place, and sit down alone. This meditation process is not practiced in a place like this, a big city, where many people are gathered. One must go to a solitary place and practice alone. And then you have to carefully select your sitting place, you have to sit in a certain way … There are so many things. Of course, those things cannot be explained within a few minutes. If you are very much interested, you’ll find a full description in <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> in the chapter called “<em>Dhyāna-yoga</em>.”</div></div><div id="bb94663" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So from the bodily concept of life one has to transcend, to the spiritual platform. That is the goal of any genuine process of self-realization. I began by saying that at first we are all thinking we are the body. <em>Indriyāṇi parāṇy āhuḥ.</em> Then, one who has transcended the bodily concept of life comes to the platform of mind. <em>Indriyebhyaḥ paraṁ manaḥ.</em> The word <em>manaḥ</em> means “mind.” Practically the whole population of the world is under the bodily concept of life, but above them are some people who are under the mental concept of life. They are thinking they are the mind. And a few people are on the intellectual platform: <em>manasas tu parā buddhiḥ. Buddhiḥ</em> means “intelligence.” And when you transcend the intellectual platform also, then you come to the spiritual platform. That is the first realization required.</div></div><div id="bb94664" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Before you practice transcendental meditation, you have to reach the transcendental platform. That transcendental platform is called<em> brahma-bhūtaḥ.</em> Perhaps you have heard this word – Brahman. The transcendentalist thinks, “<em>Ahaṁ brahmāsmi:</em> I am not the body; I am not the mind; I am not the intelligence; I am spirit soul.” This is the transcendental platform.</div></div><div id="bb94665" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">We are talking of transcendental meditation. So, by transcending the bodily concept of life, transcending the mental concept of life, and transcending the intellectual concept of life, you come to the real, spiritual platform, which is called the <em>brahma-bhūtaḥ</em> stage. You cannot simply say some words – “Now I have realized Brahman.” There are symptoms. Everything has symptoms, and how you can know if someone has realized transcendence, Brahman, is explained in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> [18.54]: <em>brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā.</em> When one is on the transcendental platform, the <em>brahma-bhūtaḥ</em> stage, his symptom is that he’s always joyful. There is no moroseness.</div></div><div id="bb94666" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">And what does <em>joyful</em> mean? That is also explained: <em>na śocati na kāṅkṣati.</em> Someone on the transcendental platform does not hanker after anything, nor does he lament. On the material platform we have two symptoms: hankering and lamenting. The things we do not possess we hanker after, and the things we have lost we lament for. These are the symptoms of the bodily concept of life.</div></div><div id="bb94667" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The whole material world is hankering after sex. That is the basic principle of hankering. <em>Puṁsaḥ striyā mithunī-bhāvam etam. Mithunī-bhāvam</em> means sex. Whether you look at the human society or the animal society or the bird society or the insect society, everywhere you will find that sex is very prominent. That is the materialistic way of life. A boy is hankering after a girl, a girl is hankering after a boy; a man is hankering after a woman, a woman is hankering after a man. This is going on.</div></div><div id="bb94668" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">And as soon as the man and woman unite, the hard knot in the heart is tied. <em>Tayor mitho hṛdaya-granthim āhuḥ.</em> They think, “I am matter, this body. This body belongs to me. This woman or man belongs to me. This country belongs to me. This world belongs to me.” That is the hard knot. Instead of transcending the bodily concept of life, they become still more implicated. The situation becomes very difficult. Therefore Kṛṣṇa recommends in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> that if you are at all interested in practicing <em>yoga</em> and meditation, in trying to rise to the transcendental platform, you must cease from sex.</div></div><div id="bb94669" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">But in the present age that is not possible. So in our method, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we don’t say, “Stop sex.” We say, “Don’t have illicit sex.” Of course, what to speak of transcendental life, giving up illicit sex is a requirement of <em>civilized</em> life. In every civilized society there is a system of marriage, and if there is sex outside of marriage, that is called illicit sex. That is never allowed for people in any civilized society, what to speak of those trying for transcendental life. Transcendental life must be purified of all mental and bodily concepts of self.</div></div><div id="bb94670" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">But in this age of Kali, where everyone is disturbed, always full of anxieties, and where life is very short, people are generally not interested in any transcendental subject matter. They are interested only in the bodily concept of life. When one is always disturbed by so many anxieties, how can he ascend to the platform of transcendental realization? It is very difficult in this age. It was difficult even five thousand years ago, when Arjuna took instruction on meditation from Kṛṣṇa in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>. Arjuna was a royal prince; he was very much advanced in so many ways. Yet on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra he said, “My dear Kṛṣṇa, it is not possible for me to practice this transcendental meditation, this <em>dhyāna-yoga</em> process. I am a family man; I have come here to fight for my political interest. How can I practice this system, in which I have to go to a solitary place, I have to sit down, I have to cease from sex? It is not possible.” Arjuna was so much more qualified than we are, yet he refused to practice this meditation process.</div></div><div id="bb94671" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So, reaching the transcendental platform by the <em>haṭha-yoga</em> or <em>dhyāna-yoga</em> system is not at all possible in this age. And if somebody is trying to practice such so-called meditation, he is not actually practicing transcendental meditation. You cannot perform this transcendental meditation in the city. It is not possible. That is very clearly stated in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>. But you are living in the city, you are living with your family, you are living with your friends. It is not possible for you to go to the forest and find a secluded place. But Kṛṣṇa says you must do this to practice transcendental meditation.</div></div><div id="bb94672" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So here, in this age, if you want to rise to the transcendental platform, then you must follow the recommendations of the Vedic literature: <em>kalau tad dhari-kīrtanāt.</em> In this age, simply by chanting the holy name of God one can reach all perfection. We are not introducing this chanting system by our mental concoction, to make things very easy. No, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu introduced this process of transcendental meditation five hundred years ago. Also, the Vedic literature recommends it, and it is practical. You have seen that my disciples, these boys and girls, immediately experience a transcendental feeling as soon as they begin chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. If you practice, you will also see how you are rising to the transcendental platform. So chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare is the easiest process of transcendental meditation.</div></div><div id="bb94673" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">This transcendental sound vibration will immediately carry you to the transcendental platform, especially if you try to hear so that your mind is absorbed in the sound. This Hare Kṛṣṇa sound vibration is nondifferent from Kṛṣṇa, because Kṛṣṇa is absolute. Since God is absolute, there is no difference between God’s name and God Himself. In the material world there is a difference between water and the word <em>water,</em> between a flower and the word <em>flower.</em> But in the spiritual world, in the absolute world, there is no such difference. Therefore, as soon as you vibrate Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, you immediately associate with the Supreme Lord and His energy.</div></div><div id="bb94674" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The word <em>Hare</em> indicates the energy of the Supreme Lord. Everything is being done by the energy of the Supreme Lord. <em>Parasya brahmaṇaḥ śaktiḥ.</em> Just as the planets are a creation of the energy of the sun, so the whole material and spiritual manifestation is a creation of the energy of the Supreme Lord. So when we chant Hare Kṛṣṇa we are praying to the energy of the Supreme Lord and to the Supreme Lord Himself: “Please pick me up. Please pick me up. I am in the bodily concept of life. I am in this material existence. I am suffering. Please pick me up to the spiritual platform, so that I will be happy.”</div></div><div id="bb94675" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">You haven’t got to change your situation. If you are a student, remain a student. If you are a businessman, remain a businessman. Woman, man, black, white – anyone can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. It is a simple process, and there is no charge. We are not saying, “Give me so many dollars, and I shall give you this Hare Kṛṣṇa <em>mantra.</em>” No, we are distributing it publicly. You simply have to catch it up and try it. You’ll very quickly come to the transcendental platform. When you hear the chanting, that is transcendental meditation.</div></div><div id="bb94676" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">This process is recommended in all the scriptures of the Vedic literature, it was taught by Lord Caitanya and followed by His disciplic succession for the last five hundred years, and people are achieving good results from it today, not only in India but here also. If you try to understand what this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is, you’ll understand how transcendental meditation is possible. We are not sentimentalists; we have many books: <em>Bhagavad-gītā As It Is, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Teachings of Lord Caitanya, Īśopaniṣad.</em> And we have our magazine, <em>Back to Godhead.</em> It is not that we are sentimentalists. We are backed up by high philosophical thought. But if you take up this simple process – chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare – you are immediately elevated to the transcendental platform, even without reading so much philosophical literature. This Hare Kṛṣṇa <em>mantra</em> is Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s gift to the conditioned souls of the present age, in accordance with the Vedic sanction.</div></div><div id="bb94677" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So our request is that you give it a try. Simply chant, at home or anywhere. There is no restriction: “You have to chant this Hare Kṛṣṇa <em>mantra</em> in such-and-such a place, in such-and-such a condition.” No. <em>Niyamitaḥ smaraṇe na kālaḥ.</em> There is no restriction of time, circumstances, or atmosphere. Anywhere, at any time, you can meditate by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. No other meditation is possible while you are walking on the street, but <em>this</em> meditation is possible. You are working with your hands? You can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. It is so nice.</div></div><div id="bb94678" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><em>Kṛṣṇa</em> is the perfect name for God. The Sanskrit word <em>kṛṣṇa</em> means “all-attractive.” And <em>rāma</em> means “the supreme pleasure.” So if God is not all-attractive and full of supreme pleasure, then what is the meaning of God? God must be the source of supreme pleasure; otherwise how could you be satisfied with Him? Your heart is hankering after so many pleasures. If God cannot satisfy you with all pleasures, then how can He be God? And He must also be all-attractive. If God is not attractive to every person, how can He be God? But Kṛṣṇa actually <em>is</em> all-attractive.</div></div><div id="bb94679" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So the Hare Kṛṣṇa <em>mantra</em> is not sectarian. Because we are chanting these three names – <em>Hare, Kṛṣṇa,</em> and <em>Rāma –</em> someone may think, “These are Hindu names. Why should we chant these Hindu names?” There are some sectarian people who may think like that. But Lord Caitanya says, “It doesn’t matter. If you have some other bona fide name of God, you can chant that. But chant God’s name.” That is the instruction of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. So do not think that this movement is trying to convert you from Christian to Hindu. Remain a Christian, a Jew, a Muslim. It doesn’t matter. But if you really want to perfect your life, then try to develop your dormant love for God. That is the perfection of life.</div></div><div id="bb94680" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><em>Sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje.</em> You may profess any religion, but to test whether your religion is perfect or whether you are perfect, you have to see whether you have developed your love for God. Now we are distributing our love among so many things. But when all this love is concentrated simply on God, that is the perfection of love. Our love is there, but because we have forgotten our relationship with God, we are directing our love toward dogs. That is our disease. We have to transfer our love from so many dogs to God. That is the perfection of life.</div></div><div id="bb94681" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So we are not teaching any particular type of religion.

So I would have to refrain from enjoying that external beauty and instead engage in meditation to see the beauty within. That is called <em>pratyāhāra.</em> Similarly, I would have to hear <em>oṁkāra –</em> the sound representation of the Lord – from within. And in the same way, all the senses must be withdrawn from their external activities and engaged in meditation on God. That is the perfection of <em>dhyāna-yoga:</em> to concentrate the mind on Viṣṇu, or God. The mind is very agitating. So it has to be fixed on the heart: <em>mano hṛdi nirudhya.</em> Then we have to transfer the life air to the top of the head: <em>mūrdhny ādhāyātmanaḥ prāṇam āsthito yoga-dhāraṇām.</em> That is the perfection of <em>yoga.</em></div></div><div id="bb94692" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">A perfect <em>dhyāna-yogī</em> can choose his own destination after death.

Rest assured. This is not the process to reach another planet. Maybe, by scientific progress, one man or two men can succeed, but that is not the general process. The general process is that if you want to transfer yourself to any better planet, then you have to practice this <em>dhyāna-yoga</em> system – or the <em>jñāna</em> system.

Those who render devotional service to Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Lord, are not interested in any planet of this material world. Why? Because they know that regardless of what planet you elevate yourself to, the four principles of material existence will still be there. What are those principles? Birth, death, disease, and old age. You will find these on any planet you go to. On some higher planets your duration of life may be very, very much longer than on this earth, but still, death is there. Material life means birth, death, disease, and old age. And spiritual life means relief from these botherations. No more birth, no more death, no more ignorance, and no more misery.

For example, although we cannot live in the water with this body, we can live in the water with oxygen tanks – for fifteen or sixteen hours. But the fish, the aquatic animals, have a suitable body – they are living their whole life underwater. And of course, if you take the fish out of the water and put them on the land, they’ll die instantly. So you see, even on this planet you have to have a suitable kind of body to live in a particular place.

God’s body is <em>sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha: īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ.

Therefore, the illusory energy [<em>māyā</em>] gives him all kinds of misery in his material existence.” I am a spiritual soul, part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but as soon as my mind is contaminated I rebel, because I have a little independence. “Why shall I serve Kṛṣṇa, or God? <em>I</em> am God.” When this idea is dictated from the mind, my whole situation turns. I come under a false impression, an illusion, and my whole life is spoiled.

One who cannot control his mind lives always with the greatest enemy, and thus his life and its mission are spoiled. The constitutional position of the living entity is to carry out the order of the superior. As long as one’s mind remains an unconquered enemy, one has to serve the dictations of lust, anger, avarice, illusion, and so on. But when the mind is conquered, one voluntarily agrees to abide by the dictation of the Personality of Godhead, who is situated within the heart of everyone as the Supersoul (Paramātmā). Real <em>yoga</em> practice entails meeting the Paramātmā within the heart and then following His dictation.

When one’s mind is fixed on the superior nature, one has no alternative but to follow the dictation of the Supreme from within. The mind must admit some superior dictation and follow it. The effect of controlling the mind is that one automatically follows the dictation of the Paramātmā, or Supersoul. Because this transcendental position is at once achieved by one who is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the devotee of the Lord is unaffected by the dualities of material existence – distress and happiness, cold and heat, and so on.

The <em>Brahma-saṁhitā,</em> for example, says, <em>īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ:</em> “The supreme controller is Kṛṣṇa, who has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body.” Those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance simply imagine the form of God.

And not only we but all the different kinds of living entities have forms. Wherefrom have they come? Wherefrom have these forms originated? These are very commonsense questions. If God is not a person, then how have His sons become persons? If my father is not a person, how have I become a person? If my father has no form, wherefrom did I get my form? Nonetheless, when people are frustrated, when they see that their bodily forms are troublesome, they develop an opposite conception of form, and they imagine that God must be formless. But the <em>Brahma-saṁhitā</em> says no. God has a form, but His form is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss (<em>īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ</em>). <em>Sat</em> means “eternity,” <em>cit</em> means “knowledge,” and <em>ānanda</em> means “pleasure.” So God has a form, but His form is full of pleasure, full of knowledge, and eternal.</div></div><div id="bb94743" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now, let’s compare our body to God’s.

Therefore we think that since God must be the opposite of us, He must have no form. This is speculation, however, not knowledge. As it is said in the <em>Padma Purāṇa, ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ:</em> “One cannot understand the form, name, quality, or paraphernalia of God with one’s material senses.” Our senses are imperfect, so how can we see the Supreme Person?

It is just as if we had cataracts on our eyes. Because our eyes are suffering from cataracts, we cannot see. But this does not mean that there is nothing to be seen – only that <em>we</em> cannot see. Similarly, now we cannot conceive of the form of God, but if our cataracts are removed, we can see Him. The <em>Brahma-saṁhitā</em> says, <em>premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocaneṇa santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti:</em> “The devotees whose eyes are anointed with the love-of-God ointment see God, Kṛṣṇa, within their hearts twenty-four hours a day.” So, we require to purify our senses. Then we’ll be able to understand what the form of God is, what the name of God is, what the qualities of God are, what the abode of God is, and what the paraphernalia of God are, and we’ll be able to see God in everything.</div></div><div id="bb94745" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The Vedic literature is full of references to God’s form. For example, it is said that God has no hands or legs but that He can accept anything you offer: <em>apāṇi-pādo javano grahītā.</em> Also, it is said that God has no eyes or ears but that He can see everything and hear everything. So, these are apparent contradictions, because whenever we think of someone seeing, we think he must have eyes like ours. This is our material conception. Factually, however, God does have eyes, but His eyes are different from ours. He can see even in the darkness, but we cannot. God can hear, also. God is in His kingdom, which is millions and millions of miles away, but if we are whispering something – conspiracy – He can hear it, because He is sitting within us.</div></div><div id="bb94746" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So, we cannot avoid God’s seeing or God’s hearing or God’s touching. In the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> [9.26] Lord Kṛṣṇa says,</div></div><div id="bb94747" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic"><em>patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ<br />yo me bhaktyā prayacchati<br /> tad ahaṁ bhakty-upahṛtam<br />aśnāmi prayatātmanaḥ</em></div></div><div id="bb94748" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">“If somebody offers Me flowers, fruits, vegetables, or milk with devotional love, I accept and eat it.” Now, how is He eating? We cannot see Him eat, but He is eating. We experience this daily: When we offer Kṛṣṇa food according to the ritualistic process, we see that the taste of the food changes immediately. This is practical. So God eats, but because He is full in Himself, He does not eat like us. If someone offers me a plate of food, I may finish it, but God is not hungry, so when He eats He leaves the things as they are. <em>Pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya pūrṇam evāvaśiṣyate:</em> God is so full that He can eat all the food that we offer and still it remains as it is. He can eat with His eyes. This is stated in the <em>Brahma-saṁhitā: aṅgāni yasya sakalendriya-vṛttimanti.</em> “Every limb of the body of God has all the potencies of the other limbs.” For example, we can see with our eyes, but we cannot <em>eat</em> with our eyes. But if God simply sees the food we have offered, that is His eating.</div></div><div id="bb94749" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Of course, these things cannot be understood by us at the present moment. Therefore, the <em>Padma Purāṇa</em> says that only when one becomes spiritually saturated by transcendental service to the Lord are the transcendental name, form, qualities, and pastimes of the Lord revealed to him. We cannot understand God by our own endeavor, but God can reveal Himself to us. Trying to see God by our own efforts is just like trying to see the sun when it is dark outside. If we say, “Oh, I have a very strong flashlight, and I shall search out the sun,” we will not be able to see it. But in the morning, when the sun rises out of its own will, we can see it. Similarly, we cannot see God by our own endeavor, because our senses are all imperfect. We have to purify our senses and wait for the time when God will be pleased to reveal Himself before us. This is the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We cannot challenge, “Oh, my dear God, my dear Kṛṣṇa, You must come before me. I shall see You.” No, God is not our order-supplier, our servant. When He is pleased with us, we’ll see Him.</div></div><div id="bb94750" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So, our <em>yoga</em> process tries to please God so that He will reveal Himself to us. That is the real <em>yoga</em> process. Without this process, people are accepting so many nonsensical “Gods.” Because people cannot see God, anybody who says “I am God” is accepted. No one knows who God is. Somebody may say, “I am searching after truth,” but he must know what truth is. Otherwise, how will he search out truth? Suppose I want to purchase gold. I must know what gold is, or at least have some experience of it. Otherwise, people will cheat me. So, people are being cheated – accepting so many rascals as God – because they do not know what God is. Anyone can come and say, “I am God,” and some rascal will accept him as God. The man who says “I am God” is a rascal, and the man who accepts him as God is also a rascal. God cannot be known like this. One has to qualify himself to see God, to understand God. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. <em>Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ:</em> If we engage ourselves in the service of the Lord, then we’ll become qualified to see God. Otherwise, it is not possible.</div></div><div id="bb94751" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now, this <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> is the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. No one can become Kṛṣṇa conscious simply by mundane scholarship. Simply because one has some titles – M.A., B.A., Ph.D. – that does not mean he’ll understand the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>. This is a transcendental science, and one requires different senses to understand it. So one has to purify his senses by rendering service to the Lord. Otherwise, even if one is a great scholar – a doctor or a Ph.D. – he will make mistakes in trying to find out what Kṛṣṇa is. He will not understand – it is not possible. This is why Kṛṣṇa appears in the material world as He is. Although He is unborn (<em>ajo ’pi sann avyayātmā</em>), He comes to make us know who God is. But since He is not personally present now, to know Him one must be fortunate enough to associate with a person who is in pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person has realized knowledge, by the grace of Kṛṣṇa, because He is satisfied with pure devotional service. So we have to acquire the grace of Kṛṣṇa. Then we can understand Kṛṣṇa, then we can see Kṛṣṇa, then we can talk with Kṛṣṇa – then we can do everything.</div></div><div id="bb94752" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Kṛṣṇa is a <em>person.</em> He is the supreme <em>person.</em> That is the Vedic injunction: <em>nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām –</em> “We are all eternal persons, and God is the supreme eternal person.” Now we are meeting birth and death because we are encaged within this body. But actually, being eternal spirit souls, we have no birth and death at all. According to our work, according to our desire, we are transmigrating from one kind of body to another, another, and another. Yet actually, we have no birth and death. As explained in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> [2.20], <em>na jāyate mriyate vā:</em> “The living entity never takes birth, nor does he ever die.” Similarly, God is also eternal. <em>Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām:</em> “God is the supreme living entity among all living entities, and He is the supreme eternal person among eternal persons.” So, by practicing Kṛṣṇa consciousness, by purifying our senses, we can reestablish our eternal relationship with the supreme eternal person, the complete eternal person. Then we will see God.</div></div><div id="bb94753" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Through realized knowledge one becomes perfect. Through transcendental knowledge one can remain steady in his convictions, but with mere academic knowledge one can be easily deluded and confused by apparent contradictions. It is the realized soul who is actually self-controlled, because he is surrendered to Kṛṣṇa. And he is transcendental, because he has nothing to do with mundane scholarship. For him, mundane scholarship and mental speculation (which may be as good as gold to others) are of no greater value than pebbles or stones.</div></div><div id="bb94754" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Even if one is illiterate, even if he does not know the ABC’s, he can realize God – provided he engages himself in submissive transcendental loving service to God. On the other hand, although one is a very learned scholar, he may not be able to realize God. God is not subject to any material condition, because He is the supreme spirit. Similarly, the process of realizing God is also not subject to any material condition. It is not true that because one is a poor man he cannot realize God, or that because one is a very rich man he shall realize God. No. God is beyond our material conditions (<em>apratihatā</em>). In the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> [1.2.6] it is said, <em>sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje:</em> “That religion is first class which helps one advance his devotional service and love of God.”</div></div><div id="bb94755" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The <em>Bhāgavatam</em> does not mention that the Hindu religion is first class or the Christian religion is first class or the Mohammedan religion is first class or some other religion is first class. The <em>Bhāgavatam</em> says that that religion is first class which helps one advance his devotional service and love of God. That’s all. This is the definition of a first-class religion. We do not analyze that one religion is first class or that another religion is last class. Of course, there are three qualities in the material world (goodness, passion, and ignorance), and religious conceptions are created according to these qualities. But the <em>purpose</em> of religion is to understand God and to learn how to love God. <em>Any</em> religious system, if it teaches one how to love God, is first class. Otherwise, it is useless. One may prosecute his religious principles very rigidly and very nicely, but if his love of God is nil, if his love of matter is simply enhanced, then his religion is no religion.</div></div><div id="bb94756" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the same verse, the <em>Bhāgavatam</em> says that real religion must be <em>ahaitukī</em> and <em>apratihatā:</em> without selfish motivation and without any impediment. If we can practice such a system of religious principles, then we’ll find that we are happy in all respects. Otherwise there is no possibility of happiness. <em>Sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje.</em> One of God’s names is Adhokṣaja. <em>Adhokṣaja</em> means “one who conquers all materialistic attempts to be seen.” <em>Akṣaja</em> means “direct perception by experimental knowledge,” and <em>adhaḥ</em> means “unreachable.” We cannot understand God by experimental knowledge. No. We have to learn of Him in a different way – by submissive aural reception of transcendental sound and by the rendering of transcendental loving service. Then we can understand God.</div></div><div id="bb94757" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So, a religious principle is perfect if it teaches us how to develop our love for the Godhead. But our love must be without selfish motive. If I say, “I love God because He supplies me very nice things for my sense gratification,” that is not love. Real love is without any selfish motive (<em>ahaitukī</em>). We must simply think, “God is great; God is my father. It is my duty to love Him.” That’s all. <em>No exchange –</em> “Oh, God gives me my daily bread; therefore I love God.” No. God gives daily bread even to the animals – the cats and dogs. God is the father of everyone, and He supplies food to everyone. So, appreciating God because He gives me bread – that is not love. Love without motive. I must think, “Even if God does not supply me daily bread, I’ll love Him.” This is real love. As Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, <em>āśliṣya vā pāda-ratāṁ pinaṣṭu mām adarśanān marma-hatāṁ karotu vā:</em> “O Lord, You may embrace me, or You may trample me down with Your feet. Or You may never come before me, so that I become brokenhearted without seeing You. Still, I love You.” This is pure love of God. When we come to this stage of loving God, then we’ll find ourselves full of pleasure. Just as God is full of pleasure, we’ll also be full of pleasure. This is perfection.</div></div><div id="bb94758" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">The Ultimate Yoga</h2></div><div id="bb94759" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify italic"><em>In this 1969 discourse, Śrīla Prabhupāda focuses on the perfected stage of</em> yoga<em> practice.

The English word <em>worship</em> cannot be used in the same sense as <em>bhaja. To worship</em> means “to adore” or “to show respect and honor to a worthy one.” But service with love and faith is especially meant for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can avoid worshiping a respectable man or a demigod and be called merely discourteous, but one cannot avoid serving the Supreme Lord without being thoroughly condemned.</div></div><div id="bb94764" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So, worship is very different from devotional service. Worship involves some selfish motive. We may worship some very big businessman because we know that if we please him, he may give us some business and we’ll derive some profit. The worship of the demigods is like that. People often worship one of the demigods for some particular purpose, but this is condemned in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> [7.20]: <em>kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ prapadyante ’nya-devatāḥ –</em> “Those who have lost their sense and are bewildered by lust worship demigods with a selfish motive.”</div></div><div id="bb94765" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Thus when we speak of worship, there is a selfish motive, but when we speak of devotional service, there is no motive except the desire to please the beloved. Devotional service is based on love. For example, when a mother renders service to her child, there is no personal motive: she serves only out of love. Everyone else may neglect the child, but the mother cannot, because she loves him. Similarly, when there is a question of service to God, there should be no question of a personal motive. That is perfect Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and that is recommended in <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> [1.2.6] in the description of the first-class system of religious principles: <em>sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje –</em> “The first-class system of religious principles is that which enables one to develop one’s God consciousness, or love of God.” If one can develop one’s love for God, one may follow any religious principle – it doesn’t matter.

That is third-class religion. First-class religion is that by which one can develop one’s love of God, and that love must be without any personal motive and without any impediment (<em>ahaituky apratihatā</em>). That is first-class religion, as recommended here by Kṛṣṇa in this final verse of the sixth chapter of <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>.</div></div><div id="bb94767" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the perfection of <em>yoga,</em> but even if one looks at it from a religious viewpoint it is first class – because it is performed with no personal motive. My disciples are not serving Kṛṣṇa so that He will supply them with this or that. There may be this or that, but that doesn’t matter. Of course, there is no scarcity; devotees get everything they need. We shouldn’t think that by becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious one becomes poor. No. If Kṛṣṇa is there, everything is there, because Kṛṣṇa <em>is</em> everything. But we shouldn’t make any business with Kṛṣṇa: “Kṛṣṇa, give me this, give me that.” Kṛṣṇa knows what we require better than we do, just as a father knows the necessities of his child. Why should we ask? Since God is all-powerful, He knows our wants and He knows our necessities. This is confirmed in the <em>Vedas: eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān –</em> “God is supplying all the necessities of the innumerable living entities.”</div></div><div id="bb94768" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">We should simply try to love God, without demanding anything.

So why should a devotee not get his necessities? If the cats and dogs can get their necessities of life without demanding anything from God, why should we demand from God, “Give me this, give me that”? No. We should simply try to love Him and serve Him. That will fulfill everything, and that is the highest platform of <em>yoga.</em></div></div><div id="bb94769" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Service to God is natural; since I am part and parcel of God, my natural duty is to serve Him. The example of the finger and the body is appropriate. The finger is part and parcel of the body. And what is the duty of the finger? To serve the whole body, that’s all. If you are feeling some itch, immediately your finger is working. If you want to see, your eyes immediately work. If you want to go somewhere, your legs immediately take you there. So, the bodily parts and limbs are helping the whole body.</div></div><div id="bb94770" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Similarly, we are all part and parcel of God, and we are all meant simply for rendering service to Him. When the limbs of the body serve the whole body, the energy automatically comes to the limbs. Similarly, when we serve Kṛṣṇa, we get all our necessities automatically. <em>Yathā taror mūla-niṣecanena.</em> If one pours water on the root of a tree, the energy is immediately supplied to the leaves, the twigs, the branches, and so on. Similarly, simply by serving Kṛṣṇa, or God, we serve all other parts of creation.

Once again, the example of the finger and the body is appropriate. If one’s finger becomes diseased and cannot render service to the whole body, it simply gives one pain. Similarly, any person who is not rendering service to the Supreme Lord is simply disturbing Him, giving Him pain and trouble. Therefore, such a person has to suffer, just like a man who is not abiding by the laws of the state. Such a criminal simply gives pain to the government, and he’s liable to be punished. He may think, “I’m a very good man,” but because he’s violating the laws of the state, he’s simply torturing the government.

Just as the government collects all the painful citizens and keeps them in the prison house – “You criminals must live here so you can’t disturb people in the open state” – so God puts all the criminals who have violated His laws, who have simply given Him pain, into this material world. <em>Sthānād bhraṣṭāḥ patanty adhaḥ:</em> They fall down from their constitutional position in the spiritual world. Again we may cite the example of the finger. If your finger is extremely painful, the doctor may advise, “Mr. So-and-so, your finger has to be amputated.

If everyone is God, then what is the meaning of God?</div></div><div id="bb94781" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So, the word <em>avajānanti</em> is very appropriate. <em>Avajānanti</em> means “neglectful,” and it perfectly describes the person who says, “What is God? I am God. Why should I serve God?” This is <em>avajānanti –</em> neglecting God’s real position. A criminal may have the same attitude toward the government: “Oh, what is the government? I can do whatever I like. I don’t care for the government.” This is <em>avajānanti.</em> But even if we say, “I don’t care for the government,” the police department is there. It will give us pain; it will punish us. Similarly, even if we don’t care for God, the material nature will punish us with birth, old age, disease, and death. To get out of this suffering, we must practice <em>yoga.</em></div></div><div id="bb94782" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The culmination of all kinds of <em>yoga</em> practice lies in <em>bhakti-yoga.</em> All other <em>yogas</em> are but means to come to the point of <em>bhakti-yoga. Yoga</em> actually <em>means bhakti-yoga;</em> all other <em>yogas</em> are progressions toward this destination. From the beginning of <em>karma-yoga</em> to the end of <em>bhakti-yoga</em> is a long way to self-realization. <em>Karma-yoga,</em> executed without fruitive desires, is the beginning of this path. (Fruitive activities, or <em>karma,</em> include sinful activities also. <em>Karma-yoga,</em> however, does not include sinful activities but only good, pious activities, or prescribed activities. This is <em>karma-yoga.</em>) Then, when <em>karma-yoga</em> increases in knowledge and renunciation, the stage is called <em>jñāna-yoga.</em> When <em>jñāna-yoga</em> increases in meditation on the Supersoul by various physical processes, and when the mind is on Him, one has reached the stage called <em>aṣṭāṅga-yoga.</em> And when one surpasses <em>aṣṭāṅga-yoga</em> and comes to the point of serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, one has reached <em>bhakti-yoga,</em> the culmination.</div></div><div id="bb94783" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Factually, <em>bhakti-yoga</em> is the ultimate goal, but to analyze <em>bhakti-yoga</em> minutely one has to understand these other, minor <em>yogas.</em> The <em>yogī</em> who is progressive is therefore on the true path of eternal auspiciousness, whereas one who sticks to a particular point and does not make further progress is called by that particular name: <em>karma-yogī, jñāna-yogī,</em> or <em>aṣṭāṅga-yogī.</em> But if one is fortunate enough to come to the point of <em>bhakti-yoga,</em> it is to be understood that one has surpassed all the other <em>yogas.</em> Therefore, to become Kṛṣṇa conscious is the highest stage of <em>yoga,</em> just as, when we speak of the Himālayas, we refer to the world’s highest mountains, of which the highest peak, Mount Everest, is considered the culmination.</div></div><div id="bb94784" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">If someone practicing <em>jñāna-yoga</em> thinks that he is finished, that is wrong. He has to make further progress. For example, suppose you want to go to the highest floor of a building – say, the hundredth floor – by walking up a staircase. You will pass the thirtieth floor, the fiftieth floor, the eightieth floor, and so on. But suppose when you come to the fiftieth or eightieth floor you think, “I have reached my goal.” Then you are unsuccessful. To reach your destination you have to go to the hundredth floor. Similarly, all the processes of <em>yoga</em> are connected, like a staircase, but we shouldn’t be satisfied to stop on the fiftieth floor or the eightieth floor. We should go to the highest platform, the hundredth floor – pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div></div><div id="bb94785" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now, if somebody who wants to reach the hundredth floor is given a chance to use the elevator, within a minute he will be able to come to the top. Of course, he may still say, “Why should I take advantage of this elevator? I shall go step by step.” He can do this, but there is a chance he will not reach the top floor. Similarly, if one takes help from the “elevator” of <em>bhakti-yoga,</em> within a short time he can reach the “hundredth floor” – the perfection of <em>yoga,</em> Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div></div><div id="bb94786" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the direct process. You may go step by step, following all the other <em>yoga</em> systems, or you may take directly to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Lord Caitanya has recommended that in this age, since people are very short-lived, disturbed, and full of anxiety, they should take up the direct process. And by His grace, by His causeless mercy, He has given us the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa <em>mantra,</em> which lifts us immediately to the platform of <em>bhakti-yoga.</em> It is immediate; we don’t have to wait. That is the special gift of Lord Caitanya. Therefore Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī prayed, <em>namo mahā-vadānyāya kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te:</em> “O Lord Caitanya, You are the most munificent incarnation because You are directly giving love of Kṛṣṇa.” Ordinarily, to attain love of Kṛṣṇa one has to pass through so many steps and stages of <em>yoga,</em> but Lord Caitanya gave it directly. Therefore He is the most munificent incarnation. This is the position of Lord Caitanya.</div></div><div id="bb94787" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The only way to know God in truth is through <em>bhakti-yoga.</em> In <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> [18.55] Kṛṣṇa confirms this. <em>Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ:</em> “Only by devotional service can one understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is.” The <em>Vedas</em> confirm that only through <em>bhakti,</em> or devotional service, can one attain the highest perfectional stage. If one practices other <em>yoga</em> systems, there must be a mixture of <em>bhakti</em> if one is to make any progress. But because people don’t have sufficient time to execute all the practices of any other <em>yoga</em> system, the direct process of <em>bhakti-yoga,</em> unadulterated devotion, is recommended for this age. Therefore, it is by great fortune that one comes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the path of <em>bhakti-yoga,</em> and becomes well situated according to the Vedic directions.</div></div><div id="bb94788" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The ideal <em>yogī</em> concentrates his attention on Kṛṣṇa, who is as beautifully colored as a cloud, whose lotuslike face is as effulgent as the sun, whose dress is brilliant with jewels, and whose body is flower-garlanded. Illuminating all sides is His gorgeous luster, which is called the <em>brahma-jyotir.</em> He incarnates in different forms, such as Rāma, Varāha, and Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He descends as a human being – as the son of mother Yaśodā – and He is known as Kṛṣṇa, Govinda, and Vāsudeva. He is the perfect child, husband, friend, and master, and He is full with all opulences and transcendental qualities. One who remains fully conscious of these features of the Lord is the highest <em>yogī.</em> This stage of perfection in <em>yoga</em> can be attained only by <em>bhakti-yoga,</em> as confirmed in all Vedic literature.</div></div><div id="bb94789" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"> </div></div><div id="bb94790" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"> </div></div><div class="mt-10 flex justify-between"><a href="/en/library/josd/4/" class="inline-flex font-sans items-center px-4 py-2 mr-4 text-base font-medium bg-vb-header-top bg-opacity-30 border border-vb-header-top border-opacity-30 rounded-lg hover:bg-opacity-50"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 448 512" class="mr-2" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M257.5 445.1l-22.2 22.2c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0L7 273c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9L201.4 44.7c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0l22.2 22.2c9.5 9.5 9.3 25-.4 34.3L136.6 216H424c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24v32c0 13.3-10.7 24-24 24H136.6l120.5 114.8c9.8 9.3 10 24.8.4 34.3z"></path></svg>Chapter Four</a><a href="/en/library/josd/6/" class="inline-flex font-sans items-center px-4 py-2 text-base font-medium bg-vb-header-top bg-opacity-30 border border-vb-header-top border-opacity-30 rounded-lg hover:bg-opacity-50">Chapter Six<svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 448 512" class="ml-2" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M190.5 66.9l22.2-22.2c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0L441 239c9.4 9.4 9.4 24.6 0 33.9L246.6 467.3c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0l-22.2-22.2c-9.5-9.5-9.3-25 .4-34.3L311.4 296H24c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24v-32c0-13.3 10.7-24 24-24h287.4L190.9 101.2c-9.8-9.3-10-24.8-.4-34.3z"></path></svg></a></div></main></div><div id="footer" class="mt-auto pt-3 mb-6 text-sm text-vb-normal-text/80 text-center"><div class="px-4 py-4 w-full max-w-screen-xl mx-auto md:px-8 text-sm text-vb-normal-text/80"><div class="py-2 px-3 border border-dashed border-vb-normal-text/15 text-justify relative "><a href="/en/donate/" class="z-20 float-right my-2 ml-3 w-auto border border-vb-action-border bg-vb-action-bg hover:bg-vb-action-bg/80 rounded-md text-vb-action-text py-3 px-6 text-center disabled:opacity-50">Donate</a><span class="flex-grow">Thanks to <span>Vinod Bapat and Meenal Bapat; Mahavisnupriya dasi &amp; Gostavihari das;   Kuldip Persaud; Gagan Kangovi; Rajendra and Geeta Ramchandani; NIOS - North American Institute for Oriental and Classical Studies; Jaykumar Prabhakar; Anantha SriSimha das, Spore; Bharat Vyas; HG Lakshmipati Narayan Das; HG Ragatmika Gopika Devi Dasi; Shri Chander Mohan Gilhotra; HG Prashant Mukund Das; Shri Trilok Singh Grover; Aneesh Koppula; Ronak Talati; Bhargav Ashok; J.K Ahuja; Akiralali; Radhapati Das; Bimal Gupta; Rajasa das; Aishwarya Balaraj; Yogendra Sharad Puranik; Riya and Tejal Chopade; Devarajula Pradeep Kumar (Saroornagar, Hyderabad); Late Chetana Dilip Bhatt; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/indradyumna-swami">Indradyumna Swami</a>; Sachin; Geetanjali Nath; Mario; Joeie; Susheela and Rama Krishna Reddy Patlolla; Jai Devaki Parks; Ashmi Chakraborty; Hari-kirtana das; Ramesta das; Prasad Buddhavarapu; dasa; Kresna Sucandra; Late Mr. S.

Arjuna was a royal prince; he was very much advanced in so many ways. Yet on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra he said, “My dear Kṛṣṇa, it is not possible for me to practice this transcendental meditation, this \u003cem\u003edhyāna-yoga\u003c/em\u003e process. I am a family man; I have come here to fight for my political interest. How can I practice this system, in which I have to go to a solitary place, I have to sit down, I have to cease from sex? It is not possible.” Arjuna was so much more qualified than we are, yet he refused to practice this meditation process.2e:T475,This process is recommended in all the scriptures of the Vedic literature, it was taught by Lord Caitanya and followed by His disciplic succession for the last five hundred years, and people are achieving good results from it today, not only in India but here also. If you try to understand what this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is, you’ll understand how transcendental meditation is possible. We are not sentimentalists; we have many books: \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā As It Is, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Teachings of Lord Caitanya, Īśopaniṣad.\u003c/em\u003e And we have our magazine, \u003cem\u003eBack to Godhead.\u003c/em\u003e It is not that we are sentimentalists. We are backed up by high philosophical thought. But if you take up this simple process – chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare – you are immediately elevated to the transcendental platform, even without reading so much philosophical literature. This Hare Kṛṣṇa \u003cem\u003emantra\u003c/em\u003e is Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s gift to the conditioned souls of the present age, in accordance with the Vedic sanction.2f:T439,For the \u003cem\u003edhyāna-yogīs\u003c/em\u003e the prescription is: \u003cem\u003esarva-dvārāṇi saṁyamya mano hṛdi nirudhya ca.\u003c/em\u003e In the technical language of the \u003cem\u003eyoga\u003c/em\u003e system, this process is called \u003cem\u003epratyāhāra. Pratyāhāra\u003c/em\u003e means “just the opposite.” For example, suppose my eyes are engaged"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1," in seeing worldly beauty. So I would have to refrain from enjoying that external beauty and instead engage in meditation to see the beauty within.

And in the same way, all the senses must be withdrawn from their external activities and engaged in meditation on God. That is the perfection of \u003cem\u003edhyāna-yoga:\u003c/em\u003e to concentrate the mind on Viṣṇu, or God. The mind is very agitating.

In \u003ca href=\"/en/library/cc/madhya/20/117/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eCaitanya-caritāmṛta\u003c/em\u003e [\u003cem\u003eMadhya\u003c/em\u003e 20.117]\u003c/a\u003e it is said, \u003cem\u003ekṛṣṇa bhuli’ se jīva anādi-bahirmukha ataeva māyā tāre deya saṁsāra-duḥkha:\u003c/em\u003e “Forgetting Kṛṣṇa, the living entity has been attracted by the Lord’s external feature from time immemorial. Therefore, the illusory energy [\u003cem\u003emāyā\u003c/em\u003e] gives him all kinds of misery in his material existence.” I am a spiritual soul, part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but as soon as my mind is contaminated I rebel, because I have a little independence. “Why shall I serve Kṛṣṇa, or God? \u003cem\u003eI\u003c/em\u003e am God.” When this idea is dictated from the mind, my whole situation turns. I come under a false impression, an illusion, and my whole life is spoiled. So, we are trying to conquer so many things – empires and so on – but if we fail to conquer our minds, then even if we conquer an empire we are failures. Our very mind will be our greatest enemy.31:T425,Actually, every living entity is intended to abide by the dictation of the S"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"upreme Personality of Godhead, who is seated in everyone’s heart as Paramātmā. When the mind is misled by the external energy, one becomes entangled in material activities.

One has to abide by superior dictation. When one’s mind is fixed on the superior nature, one has no alternative but to follow the dictation of the Supreme from within. The mind must admit some superior dictation and follow it. The effect of controlling the mind is that one automatically follows the dictation of the Paramātmā, or Supersoul. Because this transcendental position is at once achieved by one who is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the devotee of the Lord is unaffected by the dualities of material existence – distress and happiness, cold and heat, and so on. This state is practical \u003cem\u003esamādhi,\u003c/em\u003e or absorption in the Supreme.32:T477,Actually, God has a form. Why not? The \u003cem\u003eVedānta-sūtra\u003c/em\u003e says, \u003cem\u003ejanmādy asya yataḥ:\u003c/em\u003e “The Supreme Absolute Truth is that from whom or from which everything emanates.” Now, \u003cem\u003ewe\u003c/em\u003e have forms. And not only we but all the different kinds of living entities have forms. Wherefrom have they come? Wherefrom have these forms originated? These are very commonsense questions. If God is not a person, then how have His sons become persons? If my father is not a person, how have I become a person? If my father has no form, wherefrom did I get my form? Nonetheless, when people are frustrated, when they see that their bodily forms are troublesome, they develop an opposite conception of form, and they imagine that God must be formless. But the \u003cem\u003eBrahma-saṁhitā\u003c/em\u003e says no. God has a form, but His form is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss (\u003cem\u003eīśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ\u003c/em\u003e). \u003cem\u003eSat\u003c/em\u003e means “eternity,” \u003cem\u003ecit\u003c/em\u003e means “knowledge,” and \u003cem\u003eānanda\u003c/em\u003e means “pleasure."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"” So God has a form, but His form is full of pleasure, full of knowledge, and eternal.33:T451,Of course, these things cannot be understood by us at the present moment. Therefore, the \u003cem\u003ePadma Purāṇa\u003c/em\u003e says that only when one becomes spiritually saturated by transcendental service to the Lord are the transcendental name, form, qualities, and pastimes of the Lord revealed to him. We cannot understand God by our own endeavor, but God can reveal Himself to us. Trying to see God by our own efforts is just like trying to see the sun when it is dark outside. If we say, “Oh, I have a very strong flashlight, and I shall search out the sun,” we will not be able to see it. But in the morning, when the sun rises out of its own will, we can see it. Similarly, we cannot see God by our own endeavor, because our senses are all imperfect. We have to purify our senses and wait for the time when God will be pleased to reveal Himself before us. This is the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We cannot challenge, “Oh, my dear God, my dear Kṛṣṇa, You must come before me. I shall see You.” No, God is not our order-supplier, our servant. When He is pleased with us, we’ll see Him.34:T484,So, our \u003cem\u003eyoga\u003c/em\u003e process tries to please God so that He will reveal Himself to us. That is the real \u003cem\u003eyoga\u003c/em\u003e process. Without this process, people are accepting so many nonsensical “Gods.” Because people cannot see God, anybody who says “I am God” is accepted. No one knows who God is. Somebody may say, “I am searching after truth,” but he must know what truth is. Otherwise, how will he search out truth? Suppose I want to purchase gold. I must know what gold is, or at least have some experience of it. Otherwise, people will cheat me. So, people are being cheated – accepting so many rascals as God – because they do not know what God is. Anyone can come and say, “I am God,” and some rascal will accept him as God. The man who says “I am God” is a rascal, and the man who accepts him as God is also a"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1," rascal. God cannot be known like this. One has to qualify himself to see God, to understand God. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. \u003cem\u003eSevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ:\u003c/em\u003e If we engage ourselves in the service of the Lord, then we’ll become qualified to see God. Otherwise, it is not possible.35:T4dd,Now, this \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e is the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. No one can become Kṛṣṇa conscious simply by mundane scholarship. Simply because one has some titles – M.A., B.A., Ph.D. – that does not mean he’ll understand the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e. This is a transcendental science, and one requires different senses to understand it. So one has to purify his senses by rendering service to the Lord. Otherwise, even if one is a great scholar – a doctor or a Ph.D. – he will make mistakes in trying to find out what Kṛṣṇa is. He will not understand – it is not possible. This is why Kṛṣṇa appears in the material world as He is. Although He is unborn (\u003cem\u003eajo ’pi sann avyayātmā\u003c/em\u003e), He comes to make us know who God is. But since He is not personally present now, to know Him one must be fortunate enough to associate with a person who is in pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person has realized knowledge, by the grace of Kṛṣṇa, because He is satisfied with pure devotional service. So we have to acquire the grace of Kṛṣṇa. Then we can understand Kṛṣṇa, then we can see Kṛṣṇa, then we can talk with Kṛṣṇa – then we can do everything.36:T44e,Kṛṣṇa is a \u003cem\u003eperson.\u003c/em\u003e He is the supreme \u003cem\u003eperson.\u003c/em\u003e That is the Vedic injunction: \u003cem\u003enityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām –\u003c/em\u003e “We are all eternal persons, and God is the supreme eternal person.” Now we are meeting birth and death because we are encaged within this body. But actually, being eternal spirit souls, we have no birth and death at all. According to our work, according to our desire, we are transmigrating from one kind of body "])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"to another, another, and another. Yet actually, we have no birth and death. As explained in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e [2.20], \u003cem\u003ena jāyate mriyate vā:\u003c/em\u003e “The living entity never takes birth, nor does he ever die.” Similarly, God is also eternal. \u003cem\u003eNityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām:\u003c/em\u003e “God is the supreme living entity among all living entities, and He is the supreme eternal person among eternal persons.” So, by practicing Kṛṣṇa consciousness, by purifying our senses, we can reestablish our eternal relationship with the supreme eternal person, the complete eternal person. Then we will see God.37:T534,So, a religious principle is perfect if it teaches us how to develop our love for the Godhead. But our love must be without selfish motive. If I say, “I love God because He supplies me very nice things for my sense gratification,” that is not love. Real love is without any selfish motive (\u003cem\u003eahaitukī\u003c/em\u003e). We must simply think, “God is great; God is my father. It is my duty to love Him.” That’s all. \u003cem\u003eNo exchange –\u003c/em\u003e “Oh, God gives me my daily bread; therefore I love God.” No. God gives daily bread even to the animals – the cats and dogs. God is the father of everyone, and He supplies food to everyone. So, appreciating God because He gives me bread – that is not love. Love without motive. I must think, “Even if God does not supply me daily bread, I’ll love Him.” This is real love. As Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, \u003cem\u003eāśliṣya vā pāda-ratāṁ pinaṣṭu mām adarśanān marma-hatāṁ karotu vā:\u003c/em\u003e “O Lord, You may embrace me, or You may trample me down with Your feet. Or You may never come before me, so that I become brokenhearted without seeing You. Still, I love You.” This is pure love of God. When we come to this stage of loving God, then we’ll find ourselves full of pleasure. Just as God is full of pleasure, we’ll also be full of pleasure. This is perfection.38:T4b0,The culmination of all kinds of \u003cem\u003eyoga\u003c/em\u003e practice lies in \u003cem\u003eb"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"hakti-yoga.\u003c/em\u003e All other \u003cem\u003eyogas\u003c/em\u003e are but means to come to the point of \u003cem\u003ebhakti-yoga.

(Fruitive activities, or \u003cem\u003ekarma,\u003c/em\u003e include sinful activities also. \u003cem\u003eKarma-yoga,\u003c/em\u003e however, does not include sinful activities but only good, pious activities, or prescribed activities.

They are interested only in the bodily concept of life. When one is always disturbed by so many anxieties, how can he ascend to the platform of transcendental realization? It is very difficult in this age. It was difficult even five thousand years ago, when Arjuna took instruction on meditation from Kṛṣṇa in \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e. Arjuna was a royal prince; he was very much advanced in so many ways. Yet on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra he said, “My dear Kṛṣṇa, it is not possible for me to practice this transcendental meditation, this \u003cem\u003edhyāna-yoga\u003c/em\u003e process. I am a family man; I have come here to fight for my political interest. How can I practice this system, in which I have to go to a sol"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"itary place, I have to sit down, I have to cease from sex? It is not possible.” Arjuna was so much more qualified than we are, yet he refused to practice this meditation process.3c:T475,This process is recommended in all the scriptures of the Vedic literature, it was taught by Lord Caitanya and followed by His disciplic succession for the last five hundred years, and people are achieving good results from it today, not only in India but here also. If you try to understand what this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is, you’ll understand how transcendental meditation is possible. We are not sentimentalists; we have many books: \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā As It Is, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Teachings of Lord Caitanya, Īśopaniṣad.\u003c/em\u003e And we have our magazine, \u003cem\u003eBack to Godhead.\u003c/em\u003e It is not that we are sentimentalists. We are backed up by high philosophical thought. But if you take up this simple process – chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare – you are immediately elevated to the transcendental platform, even without reading so much philosophical literature. This Hare Kṛṣṇa \u003cem\u003emantra\u003c/em\u003e is Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s gift to the conditioned souls of the present age, in accordance with the Vedic sanction.3d:T439,For the \u003cem\u003edhyāna-yogīs\u003c/em\u003e the prescription is: \u003cem\u003esarva-dvārāṇi saṁyamya mano hṛdi nirudhya ca.\u003c/em\u003e In the technical language of the \u003cem\u003eyoga\u003c/em\u003e system, this process is called \u003cem\u003epratyāhāra. Pratyāhāra\u003c/em\u003e means “just the opposite.” For example, suppose my eyes are engaged in seeing worldly beauty.

That is the perfection of \u003cem\u003edhyāna-yoga:\u003c/em\u003e to concentrate the mind on Viṣṇu, or God. The mind is very agitating. So it has to be fixed on the heart: \u003cem\u003emano hṛdi nirudhya.\u003c/em\u003e Then we have to transfer the life air to the top of the head: \u003cem\u003emūrdhny ādhāyātmanaḥ prāṇam āsthito yoga-dhāraṇām.\u003c/em\u003e That is the perfection of \u003cem\u003eyoga.\u003c/em\u003e3e:T425,Actually, every living entity is intended to abide by the dictation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is seated in everyone’s heart as Paramātmā. When the mind is misled by the external energy, one becomes entangled in material activities. Therefore, as soon as one’s mind is controlled through one of the \u003cem\u003eyoga\u003c/em\u003e systems, one is to be considered as having already reached the destination. One has to abide by superior dictation. When one’s mind is fixed on the superior nature, one has no alternative but to follow the dictation of the Supreme from within. The mind must admit some superior dictation and follow it. The effect of controlling the mind is that one automatically follows the dictation of the Paramātmā, or Supersoul. Because this transcendental position is at once achieved by one who is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the devotee of the Lord is unaffected by the dualities of material existence – distress and happiness, cold and heat, and so on.
