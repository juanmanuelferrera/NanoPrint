Śyāmasundara, while traveling around the world. These sessions were recorded and published to provide an understanding of Western philosophy, psychology, and science from the viewpoint of the timeless teachings of India’s Vedic literature. In the following conversation, the striking similarities between Plato’s ideal state and that outlined in the</em> Bhagavad-gīta<em> prompt one to ask, “Could Plato have gotten his ideas from India’s ancient</em> Vedas?”</div></div><div id="bb95014" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Śyāmasundara: </strong>Plato believed society can enjoy prosperity and harmony only if it places people in working categories or classes according to their natural abilities. He thought people should find out their natural abilities and use those abilities to their fullest capacity – as administrators, as military men, or as craftsmen. Most important, the head of state should not be an average or mediocre man. Instead, society should be led by a very wise and good man – a “philosopher king” – or a group of very wise and good men.</div></div><div id="bb95015" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Śrīla Prabhupāda: </strong>This idea appears to be taken from the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>, where Kṛṣṇa says that the ideal society has four divisions: <em>brāhmaṇas</em> [intellectuals], <em>kṣatriyas</em> [warriors and administrators], <em>vaiśyas</em> [merchants and farmers], and <em>śūdras</em> [laborers]. These divisions come about by the influence of the modes of nature. Everyone, both in human society and in animal society, is influenced by the modes of material nature [<em>sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa,</em> and <em>tamo-guṇa,</em> or goodness, passion, and ignorance]. By scientifically classifying men according to these qualities, society can become perfect. But if we place a man in the mode of ignorance in a philosopher’s post, or put a philosopher to work as an ordinary laborer, havoc will result.</div></div><div id="bb95016" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> Kṛṣṇa says that the <em>brāhmaṇas –</em> the most intelligent men, who are interested in transcendental knowledge and philosophy – should be given the topmost posts, and under their instructions the <em>kṣatriyas</em> [administrators] should work. The administrators should see that there is law and order and that everyone is doing his duty. The next section is the productive class, the <em>vaiśyas,</em> who engage in agriculture and cow protection. And finally there are the <em>śūdras,</em> common laborers who help the other sections. This is Vedic civilization – people living simply, on agriculture and cow protection. If you have enough milk, grains, fruits, and vegetables, you can live very nicely.</div></div><div id="bb95017" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> compares the four divisions of society to the different parts of the body – the head, the arms, the belly, and the legs. Just as all parts of the body cooperate to keep the body fit, in the ideal state all sections of society cooperate under the leadership of the <em>brāhmaṇas.</em> Comparatively, the head is the most important part of the body, for it gives directions to the other parts of the body. Similarly, the ideal state functions under the directions of the <em>brāhmaṇas,</em> who are not personally interested in political affairs or administration because they have a higher duty. At present this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is training <em>brāhmaṇas.</em> If the administrators take our advice and conduct the state in a Kṛṣṇa conscious way, there will be an ideal society throughout the world.</div></div><div id="bb95018" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Śyāmasundara: </strong>How does modern society differ from the Vedic ideal?</div></div><div id="bb95019" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Śrīla Prabhupāda: </strong>Now there is large-scale industrialization, which means exploitation of one man by another.

They are not allowed to kill many birds and beasts unnecessarily, as King Vena was doing and as people do today. At that time the intelligent <em>brāhmaṇas</em> objected and immediately killed him with a curse.

The head is very important, and our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is attempting to create some <em>brāhmaṇas</em> who will form the head of society. Then the administrators will be able to rule very nicely under the instructions of the philosophers and theologians – that is, under the instructions of God conscious people. A God conscious <em>brāhmaṇa</em> would never advise opening slaughterhouses. But now, the many rascals heading the government allow animal slaughter. When Mahārāja Parīkṣit saw a degraded man trying to kill a cow, he immediately drew his sword and said, “Who are you? Why are you trying to kill this cow?” He was a real king. Nowadays, unqualified men have taken the presidential post. And although they may pose themselves as very religious, they are simply rascals. Why? Because under their noses thousands of cows are being killed, while they collect a good salary. Any leader who is at all religious should resign his post in protest if cow slaughter goes on under his rule. Since people do not know that these administrators are rascals, they are suffering. And the people are also rascals because they are voting for these bigger rascals. It is Plato’s view that the government should be ideal, and this is the ideal: The saintly philosophers should be at the head of the state; according to their advice the politicians should rule; under the protection of the politicians, the productive class should provide the necessities of life; and the laborer class should help. This is the scientific division of society that Kṛṣṇa advocates in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> [4.13]: <em>cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ.</em> “According to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me.”</div></div><div id="bb95022" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Śyāmasundara: </strong>Plato also observed social divisions.

One has to go above morality – to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Of course, in this material world morality is taken as the highest principle, but there is another platform, which is called the transcendental (<em>vasudeva</em>) platform. Man’s highest perfection is on that platform, and this is confirmed in <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em>. However, because Western philosophers have no information of the <em>vasudeva</em> platform, they consider the material mode of goodness to be the highest perfection and the end of morality. But in this world even moral goodness is infected by the lower modes of ignorance and passion. You cannot find pure goodness (<em>śuddha-sattva</em>) in this material world, for pure goodness is the transcendental platform. To come to the platform of pure goodness, which is the ideal, one has to undergo austerities (<em>tapasā brahmacaryeṇa śamena ca damena ca</em>). One has to practice celibacy and control the mind and senses. If he has money, he should distribute it in charity. Also, one should always be very clean.

If one becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious, all the good qualities automatically develop in him. Automatically he leads a life of celibacy, controls his mind and senses, and has a charitable disposition. In this age of Kali, people cannot possibly be trained to engage in austerity. Formerly, a <em>brahmacārī</em> [celibate student] would undergo austere training. Even though he might be from a royal or learned family, a <em>brahmacārī</em> would humble himself and serve the spiritual master as a menial servant. He would immediately do whatever the spiritual master ordered. The <em>brahmacārī</em> would beg alms from door to door and bring them to the spiritual master, claiming nothing for himself. Whatever he earned he would give to the spiritual master, because the spiritual master would not spoil the money by spending it for sense gratification – he would use it for Kṛṣṇa. This is austerity. The <em>brahmacārī</em> would also observe celibacy, and because he followed the directions of the spiritual master, his mind and senses were controlled.</div></div><div id="bb95033" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Today, however, this austerity is very difficult to follow, so Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has given the process of taking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness directly.

If one is naturally inclined to philosophical study, why should he waste his time in the military? And if one is naturally inclined to military training, why should he waste his time with other things? Arjuna belonged to a <em>kṣatriya</em> [warrior] family. He and his brothers were never trained as philosophers. Droṇācārya was their master and teacher, and although he was a <em>brāhmaṇa,</em> he taught them <em>Dhanur Veda</em> [military science], not <em>brahma-vidyā. Brahma-vidyā</em> is theistic philosophy. No one should be trained in everything; that is a waste of time. If one is inclined toward production, business, or agriculture, he should be trained in those fields. If one is philosophical, he should be trained as a philosopher. If one is militaristic, he should be trained as a warrior. And if one has ordinary ability, he should remain a <em>śūdra,</em> or laborer. This is stated by Nārada Muni in <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: yasya yal-lakṣaṇaṁ proktam.</em> The four classes of society are recognized by their symptoms and qualifications. Nārada Muni also says that one should be selected for training according to his qualifications. Even if one is born in a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> family, he should be considered a <em>śūdra</em> if his qualifications are those of a <em>śūdra.</em> And if one is born in a <em>śūdra</em> family, he should be taken as a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> if his symptoms are brahminical. The spiritual master should be expert enough to recognize the tendencies of the student and immediately train him in that line.

How will increased production satisfy them? If someone were to say to them, “If you give up this <em>yoga</em> practice, I will give you two hundred bags of rice,” they would laugh at the proposal. It is animalistic to think that simply by increasing production everyone will become satisfied. Real happiness does not depend on either production or starvation, but upon peace of mind. For example, if a child is crying but the mother does not know why, the child will not stop simply by giving him some milk. Sometimes this actually happens: the mother cannot understand why her child is crying, and though she is giving him her breast, he continues to cry. Similarly, dissatisfaction in human society is not caused solely by low economic production. That is nonsense. There are many causes of dissatisfaction. The practical example is America, where there is sufficient production of everything, yet the young men are becoming hippies. They are dissatisfied, confused. No, simply by increasing economic production people will not become satisfied. Marx’s knowledge is insufficient.

These two things must be there: an enjoyer and a worker. For example, in our body the stomach is the enjoyer and all other parts of the body are workers. So this system is natural: there must always be someone who is the enjoyer and someone who is the worker. It is present in the capitalist system also. In Russia there is always conflict between the managers and the workers. The workers say, “If this is a classless society, why is that man sitting comfortably and ordering us to work?” The Russians have not been able to avoid this dilemma, and it cannot be avoided. There <em>must</em> be one class of men who are the directors or enjoyers and another class of men who are the workers. Therefore the only way to have a truly classless society is to find that method by which both the managers and the workers will feel equal happiness. For example, if the stomach is hungry and the eyes see some food, immediately the brain will say, “O legs, please go there!” and “Hand, pick it up,” and “Now please put it into the mouth.” Immediately the food goes into the stomach, and as soon as the stomach is satisfied, the eyes are satisfied, the legs are satisfied, and the hand is satisfied.</div></div><div id="bb95092" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Śyāmasundara: </strong>But Marx would use this as a perfect example of communism.</div></div><div id="bb95093" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Śrīla Prabhupāda: </strong>But he has neglected to find out the real stomach.</div></div><div id="bb95094" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Śyāmasundara: </strong>His is the material stomach.</div></div><div id="bb95095" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Śrīla Prabhupāda: </strong>But the material stomach is always hungry again; it can never be satisfied.

Therefore you are all trying to satisfy your spiritual master. Similarly, if the communist countries can come up with a dictator who, if satisfied, automatically gives satisfaction to all the people, then we will accept such a classless society. But this is impossible. A classless society is only possible when Kṛṣṇa is in the center.

So, to a greater or lesser degree, the propensity is always there in human nature to exploit others and become wealthy. Unless this mentality is changed, there is no point in changing from a capitalist to a communist society. Material life means that everyone is seeking some profit, some adoration, and some position. By threats the state can force people to curb this tendency, but for how long? Can they change everyone’s mind by force? No, it is impossible.

Thus we can understand the position of the Russian people from the sample of that boy. We could also get further ideas by talking with Professor Kotovsky from the India Department of Moscow University. How foolish he was! He said that after death everything is finished. If this is his knowledge, and if that young boy is a sample of the citizenry, then the situation in Russia is very bleak. They may theorize about so many things, but we could not even purchase sufficient groceries in Moscow. There were no vegetables, fruits, or rice, and the milk was of poor quality.

He returned within a few minutes and said, “It weighs 11,650 pounds.” All the workers were astonished. “How did you weigh the elephant so quickly?” one of them asked. “Did you find some very large scale?” The minister replied, “No. It is impossible to weigh an elephant on a scale. I went to the river, took the elephant on a boat, and noted the watermark. After taking the elephant off the boat, I put weights in the boat until the same watermark was reached.

Because they have no idea of the pleasure of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the materialists regard sex as the highest pleasure. And how is it actually experienced? We have an itch, and when we scratch it, we feel some pleasure. But the aftereffects of sexual pleasure are abominable. The mother has to undergo labor pains, and the father has to take responsibility for raising the children nicely and giving them an education. Of course, if one is irresponsible like cats and dogs, that is another thing. But for those who are actually gentlemen, is it not painful to bear and raise children? Certainly. Therefore everyone is avoiding children by contraceptive methods. But much better is to follow the injunction of the <em>śāstras:</em> Simply try to tolerate the itching sensation and avoid so much pain. This is real psychology. That itching sensation can be tolerated if one practices Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

So the whole problem is how to stop these miseries and attain permanent happiness. Unless one stops his materialistic way of life, with its threefold miseries and repeated birth and death, there is no question of happiness. The whole Vedic civilization is based on how one can cure this materialistic disease. If we can cure this disease, its symptoms will automatically vanish. Freud is simply dealing with the symptoms of the basic disease. When you have a disease, sometimes you have headaches, sometimes your leg aches, sometimes you have a pain in your stomach, and so on.

In our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, we are giving people this ability. Freud tries to cure the reactions of one kind of shock, but other shocks will come, one after another. This is how material nature works. If you solve one problem, another problem arises immediately. And if you solve that one, another one comes.

As a result there is very little chance that he will suffer such personality disorders. In the Vedic age the leaders of society knew that if a person engaged in unrestricted sex indulgence, then the duration of his materialistic life would increase. He would have to accept a material body birth after birth. Therefore the <em>śāstras</em> enjoin that one may have sexual intercourse only if married. Otherwise it is illicit. In our Kṛṣṇa consciousness society, we prohibit illicit sex, but not legal sex. In the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> [7.11] Kṛṣṇa says, <em>dharmāviruddho bhūteṣu kamo ’smi bharatarṣabha:</em> “I am sexual intercourse that is not against religious principles.” This means that sex must be regulated. Everyone has a tendency to have sex unrestrictedly – and in Western countries they are actually doing this – but according to the Vedic system, there must be restrictions. And not only must sex be restricted, but meat-eating, gambling, and drinking as well. So in our Society we have eliminated all these things, and our Western students are becoming pure devotees of Kṛṣṇa.

The word <em>ādi</em> indicates that the basic principle is <em>maithuna,</em> sexual intercourse. The whole system of materialistic life revolves around this sexual pleasure. But this pleasure is like one drop of water in the desert. The desert requires an ocean of water. If you find one drop of water in a desert, you can certainly say, “Here is some water.” But what is its value? Similarly, there is certainly some pleasure in sex life, but what is the value of that pleasure? Compared to the unlimited pleasure of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it is like one drop of water in the desert. Everyone is seeking unlimited pleasure, but no one is becoming satisfied. They are having sex in so many different ways, and the young girls walking on the street are almost naked. The whole society has become degraded. Now the female population has increased everywhere, and every woman and girl is trying to attract a man. The men take advantage of the situation. There is a saying in Bengal: “When milk is available in the marketplace, what is the use of keeping a cow?” So men are declining to keep a wife because sex is so cheap. They are deserting their families.

For instance, in the Punjab State of India, there are fewer women because the men are very stout and strong. So when women are very easily available, the men become weak and beget female children. Sometimes they become impotent. If sex life is not restricted, there are so many disasters. And now we are actually seeing them: impotency, no marriage, increased female population. But no one knows why these things are happening or how human psychology can be controlled to avoid them.

The only way to entirely give up these lower pleasures is to take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. As Kṛṣṇa states in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> [2.59], <em>paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate:</em> “By experiencing a higher taste, he is fixed in consciousness.” And as Yāmunācārya said, “Since I have been engaged in the transcendental loving service of Kṛṣṇa, realizing ever-new pleasure in Him, whenever I think of sex pleasure I spit at the thought, and my lips curl in distaste.” That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Our prescription is that in the beginning of life the child should be taught self-restraint (<em>brahmacarya</em>) and when he is past twenty he can marry. In the beginning he should learn how to restrain his senses. If a child is taught to become saintly, his semen rises to his brain, and he is able to understand spiritual values. Wasting semen decreases intelligence. So from the beginning, if he is a <em>brahmacārī</em> and does not misuse his semen, then he will become intelligent and strong and fully grown.</div></div><div id="bb95198" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">For want of this education, everyone’s brain and bodily growth are being stunted. After the boy has been trained as a <em>brahmacārī</em>, if he still wants to enjoy sex he may get married. But because he then has full strength of body and brain, he will immediately beget a male child. And because he has been trained from childhood to renounce materialistic enjoyment, when he is fifty years old he can retire from household life. At that time naturally his firstborn child will be twenty-five years old, and he can take responsibility for maintaining the household. Household life is simply a license for sex life – that’s all. Sex is not required, but one who cannot restrain himself is given a license to get married and have sex. This is the real program that will save society. By speculating on some shock that may or may not have occurred in childhood, one will never discover the root disease. The sex impulse, as well as the impulse to become intoxicated and to eat meat, is present from the very beginning of life. Therefore one must restrain himself. Otherwise he will be implicated.</div></div><div id="bb95199" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Śyāmasundara: </strong>So the Western system of bringing up children seems artificial because the parents either repress the child too severely or don’t restrict him at all.</div></div><div id="bb95200" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Śrīla Prabhupāda: </strong>That is not good.

We say the child must rise early in the morning, worship the Deity in the temple, and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. In the beginning, force may be necessary. Otherwise the child will not become habituated. But the idea is to divert his attention to Kṛṣṇa conscious activities. Then, when he realizes he is not his body, all difficulties will disappear. As one increases his Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he becomes neglectful of all these material things. So Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the prime remedy – the panacea for all diseases.</div></div><div id="bb95201" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Śyāmasundara: </strong>Freud divided the personality into three departments: the ego, the superego, and the id.

That is false ego, or identifying oneself with one’s place of birth. We are giving everyone the information that this identification with a material body is ignorance. It is due to ignorance only that I think I am Indian, American, Hindu, or Muslim. This is egoism of the inferior quality. The superior egoism is, “I am Brahman. I am an eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa.” If a child is taught this superior egoism from the beginning, then automatically his false egoism is stopped.</div></div><div id="bb95203" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Śyāmasundara: </strong>Freud says that the ego tries to preserve the individual by organizing and controlling the irrational demands of the id.

The mind is the first element of the subtle body. The gross senses are controlled by the mind, which in turn is controlled by the intelligence. And the intelligence is controlled by the ego. So if the ego is false, then everything is false. If I falsely identify with this body because of false ego, then anything based on this false idea is also false. This is called <em>māyā,</em> or illusion. The whole of Vedic education aims at getting off this false platform and coming to the real platform of spiritual knowledge, called <em>brahma-jñāna.</em> When one comes to the knowledge that he is spirit soul, he immediately becomes happy. All his troubles are due to the false ego, and as soon as the individual realizes his true ego, the blazing fire of material existence is immediately extinguished. These philosophers are simply describing the blazing fire, but we are trying to get him out of the burning prison house of the material world altogether. They may attempt to make him happy within the fire, but how can they be successful? He must be saved from the fire. Then he will be happy. That is the message of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and that is Lord Kṛṣṇa’s message in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>. Freud identifies the body with the soul. He does not know the basic principle of spiritual understanding, which is that we are not this body. We are different from this body and are transmigrating from one body to another.

In the courtroom he said, “I have tested many persons, and I have concluded that everyone is insane to some degree. In the present case, if the defendant is pleading insanity, then you may acquit him if you like, but as far as I know, everyone is more or less insane.” And that is our conclusion as well.

But behind nature’s law is a brain. That is our proposition. Nature’s law is not blind, for behind it there is a brain, and that brain is God. We learn this from the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> [9.10]: <em>mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram.</em> Whatever is taking place in material nature is being directed by the Supreme Lord, who maintains everything in order. So the snake lays eggs by the score, and if many were not killed, the world would be overwhelmed by snakes. Similarly, male tigers kill the cubs. The economic theory of Malthus states that whenever there is overpopulation, there must be an outbreak of war, epidemic, famine, or the like to curb it.

They may be in your neighborhood or they may be in my neighborhood – the number and types are fixed. But if you simply study your neighborhood, it is not perfect knowledge. Evolution we admit. But your evolutionary theory is not perfect. Our theory of evolution is perfect. From the <em>Vedas</em> we know that there are 8,400,000 forms of bodies provided by nature, but the soul is the same in all, in spite of the different types of body. There is no change in the soul, and therefore the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> [5.18] says that one who is wise, a <em>paṇḍita,</em> does not see the species or the class; he sees oneness, equality. <em>Paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ.</em> One who sees to the bottom sees the soul, and he does not find there any difference between all these species.</div></div><div id="bb95309" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Devotee: </strong>So Darwin and other material scientists who have no information about the soul—</div></div><div id="bb95310" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Śrīla Prabhupāda: </strong>They’re missing the whole point.</div></div><div id="bb95311" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Devotee: </strong>They say that all living things tend to evolve from lower to higher.

For example, in an apartment building there are different kinds of apartments: first-class apartments, second-class apartments, third-class apartments.

But the different apartments are already there. <em>They</em> are not evolving.

Similarly, this is God’s creation. He knows how far a living entity can think, so He has made all these different species accordingly. When God thinks, “Come on, come here,” nature obliges. <em>Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi</em> [<a href="/en/library/bg/3/27/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> 3.27</a>]: Nature is offering facility. God, Kṛṣṇa, is sitting in the heart of the living entity as Paramātmā, and He knows, “He wants this.” So the Lord orders nature, “Give him this apartment,” and nature obliges: “Yes, come on; here is your apartment.” This is the real explanation.</div></div><div id="bb95316" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Devotee: </strong>I understand and accept that.

The head is very important, and our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is attempting to create some \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇas\u003c/em\u003e who will form the head of society. Then the administrators will be able to rule very nicely under the instructions of the philosophers and theologians – that is, under the instructions of God conscious people.

But now, the many rascals heading the government allow animal slaughter. When Mahārāja Parīkṣit saw a degraded man trying to kill a cow, he immediately drew his sword and said, “Who are you? Why are you trying to kill this cow?” He was a real king. Nowadays, unqualified men have taken the presidential post. And although they may pose themselves as very religious, they are simply rascals. Why? Because under their noses thousands of cows are being killed, while they collect a good salary. Any leader who is at all religious should resign his post in protest if cow slaughter goes on under his rule. Since people do not know that these administrators are rascals, they are suffering. And the people are also rascals because they are voting for these bigger rascals. It is Plato’s view that the government should be ideal, and this is the ideal: The saintly philosophers should be at the head of the state; according to their advice the politicians should rule; under the protection of the politicians, the productive class should provide the necessities of life; and the laborer class should help. This is the scientific division of society that Kṛṣṇa advocates in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e [4.13]: \u003cem\u003ecātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ.\u003c/em\u003e “According to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me.”2e:T4da,\u003cstrong\u003eŚrīla Prabhupāda: \u003c/strong\u003eBut moral goodness is not enough, because simple morality will not satisfy the soul. One has to go above morality – to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Of course, in this material world morality is taken as the highest principle, but there is another platform, which is called the transcendental (\u003cem\u003evasudeva\u003c/em\u003e) platform. Man’s highest perfection is on that platform, and this is confirmed in \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e. However, because Western philosophers have no information of the \u003cem\u003evasudeva\u003c/em\u003e platform, they consider the material mode o"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"f goodness to be the highest perfection and the end of morality. But in this world even moral goodness is infected by the lower modes of ignorance and passion. You cannot find pure goodness (\u003cem\u003eśuddha-sattva\u003c/em\u003e) in this material world, for pure goodness is the transcendental platform. To come to the platform of pure goodness, which is the ideal, one has to undergo austerities (\u003cem\u003etapasā brahmacaryeṇa śamena ca damena ca\u003c/em\u003e). One has to practice celibacy and control the mind and senses. If he has money, he should distribute it in charity. Also, one should always be very clean. In this way one can rise to the platform of pure goodness.2f:T49e,There is another process for coming to the platform of pure goodness – and that is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If one becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious, all the good qualities automatically develop in him. Automatically he leads a life of celibacy, controls his mind and senses, and has a charitable disposition. In this age of Kali, people cannot possibly be trained to engage in austerity. Formerly, a \u003cem\u003ebrahmacārī\u003c/em\u003e [celibate student] would undergo austere training. Even though he might be from a royal or learned family, a \u003cem\u003ebrahmacārī\u003c/em\u003e would humble himself and serve the spiritual master as a menial servant. He would immediately do whatever the spiritual master ordered. The \u003cem\u003ebrahmacārī\u003c/em\u003e would beg alms from door to door and bring them to the spiritual master, claiming nothing for himself. Whatever he earned he would give to the spiritual master, because the spiritual master would not spoil the money by spending it for sense gratification – he would use it for Kṛṣṇa. This is austerity. The \u003cem\u003ebrahmacārī\u003c/em\u003e would also observe celibacy, and because he followed the directions of the spiritual master, his mind and senses were controlled.30:T7e7,\u003cstrong\u003eŚrīla Prabhupāda: \u003c/strong\u003eYes, that we also say, but we disagree that everyone should go through the same training.

He should be able to see whether a boy is fit for military training, administration, or philosophy, and then he should fully train the boy according to his particular tendency. If one is naturally inclined to philosophical study, why should he waste his time in the military? And if one is naturally inclined to military training, why should he waste his time with other things? Arjuna belonged to a \u003cem\u003ekṣatriya\u003c/em\u003e [warrior] family. He and his brothers were never trained as philosophers. Droṇācārya was their master and teacher, and although he was a \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa,\u003c/em\u003e he taught them \u003cem\u003eDhanur Veda\u003c/em\u003e [military science], not \u003cem\u003ebrahma-vidyā. Brahma-vidyā\u003c/em\u003e is theistic philosophy. No one should be trained in everything; that is a waste of time. If one is inclined toward production, business, or agriculture, he should be trained in those fields. If one is philosophical, he should be trained as a philosopher. If one is militaristic, he should be trained as a warrior. And if one has ordinary ability, he should remain a \u003cem\u003eśūdra,\u003c/em\u003e or laborer.

The spiritual master should be expert enough to recognize the tendencies of the student and immediately train him in that line. This is perfect education.31:T6a4,\u003cstrong\u003eŚrīla Prabhupāda: \u003c/strong\u003eThat is useless!

Man is not meant simply for eating. He has mental necessities, intellectual necessities, spiritual necessities. In India many people sit alone silently in the jungle and practice \u003cem\u003eyoga.\u003c/em\u003e They do not require anything. How will increased production satisfy them? If someone were to say to them, “If you give up this \u003cem\u003eyoga\u003c/em\u003e practice, I will give you two hundred bags of rice,” they would laugh at the proposal. It is animalistic to think that simply by increasing production everyone will become satisfied. Real happiness does not depend on either production or starvation, but upon peace of mind. For example, if a child is crying but the mother does not know why, the child will not stop simply by giving him some milk. Sometimes this actually happens: the mother cannot understand why her child is crying, and though she is giving him her breast, he continues to cry. Similarly, dissatisfaction in human society is not caused solely by low economic production. That is nonsense. There are many causes of dissatisfaction. The practical example is America, where there is sufficient production of everything, yet the young men are becoming hippies. They are dissatisfied, confused. No, simply by increasing economic production people will not become satisfied. Marx’s knowledge is insufficient. Perhaps because he came from a country where people were starving, he had that idea.32:T5df,\u003cstrong\u003eŚrīla Prabhupāda: \u003c/strong\u003eBecause they do not know that real happiness comes from spiritual understanding.

In Russia there is always conflict between the managers and the workers.

There \u003cem\u003emust\u003c/em\u003e be one class of men who are the directors or enjoyers and another class of men who are the workers. Therefore the only way to have a truly classless society is to find that method by which both the managers and the workers will feel equal happiness. For example, if the stomach is hungry and the eyes see some food, immediately the brain will say, “O legs, please go there!” and “Hand, pick it up,” and “Now please put it into the mouth.” Immediately the food goes into the stomach, and as soon as the stomach is satisfied, the eyes are satisfied, the legs are satisfied, and the hand is satisfied.33:T51a,If you simply pour water on the root of a tree, all the branches, twigs, leaves, and flowers will be nourished. Similarly, everyone can be satisfied simply by \u003cem\u003eacyutejyā. Acyuta\u003c/em\u003e means Kṛṣṇa, and \u003cem\u003eijyā\u003c/em\u003e means worship. So this is the formula for a classless society: Make Kṛṣṇa [God] the center and do everything for Him. There are no classes in our International Society for Krishna Consciousness. Now you are writing philosophy, but if I want you to wash dishes, you will do so immediately because you know that whatever you do, you are working for Kṛṣṇa and for your spiritual master. In the material world different kinds of work have different values, but in Kṛṣṇa consciousness everything is done on the absolute platform. Whether you wash dishes or write books or worship the Deity, the value is the same because you are serving Kṛṣṇa. That is a classless society. Actually, the perfect classless society is Vṛndāvana.

When a pot of rice is boiling, you can take one grain and press it between your fingers, and if it is hot you can understand all the rice is boiling. Thus we can understand the position of the Russian people from the sample of that boy. We could also get further ideas by talking with Professor Kotovsky from the India Department of Moscow University. How foolish he was! He said that after death everything is finished. If this is his knowledge, and if that young boy is a sample of the citizenry, then the situation in Russia is very bleak. They may theorize about so many things, but we could not even purchase sufficient groceries in Moscow. There were no vegetables, fruits, or rice, and the milk was of poor quality. If that Madrasi gentleman had not contributed some dahl and rice, then practically speaking we would have starved. The Russians’ diet seemed to consist of only meat and liquor.35:T654,There is a story about a king and his prime minister. Once the king’s salaried workers complained, “We are actually working, and this minister is doing nothing, yet you are paying him such a large salary.

He returned within a few minutes and said, “It weighs 11,650 pounds.” All the workers were astonished. “How did you weigh the elephant so quickly?” one of them asked. “Did you find some very large scale?” The minister replied, “No. It is impossible to weigh an elephant on a scale. I went to the river, took the elephant on a boat, and noted the watermark. After taking the elephant off the boat, I put weights in the boat until the same watermark was reached. Then I had the elephant’s weight.” The king said to his workers, “Now do you see the difference?” One who has intelligence has strength, not the fools and the rascals.

As long as the communist idea remains materialistic, it cannot be the final revolution. They believe that the state is the owner of everything. But the state is not the owner; the real owner is God.

They say that everything must be done for the state, but in our International Society for Krishna Consciousness we are actually practicing perfect communism by doing everything for Kṛṣṇa. We know Kṛṣṇa is the supreme enjoyer of the result of all work (\u003cem\u003ebhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasām\u003c/em\u003e). The communist philosophy as it is now practiced is vague, but it can become perfect if they accept the conclusion of the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e – that Kṛṣṇa is the supreme proprietor, the supreme enjoyer, and the supreme friend of everyone. Then people will be happy.

Because they have no idea of the pleasure of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the materialists regard sex as the highest pleasure. And how is it actually experienced? We have an itch, and when we scratch it, we feel some pleasure. But the aftereffects of sexual pleasure are abominable. The mother has to undergo labor pains, and the father has to take responsibility for raising the children nicely and giving them an education. Of course, if one is irresponsible like cats and dogs, that is another thing. But for those who are actually gentlemen, is it not painful to bear and raise children? Certainly. Therefore everyone is avoiding children by contraceptive methods. But much better is to follow the injunction of the \u003cem\u003eśāstras:\u003c/em\u003e Simply try to tolerate the itching sensation and avoid so much pain. This is real psychology.

As a result there is very little chance that he will suffer such personality disorders. In the Vedic age the leaders of society knew that if a person engaged in unrestricted sex indulgence, then the duration of his materialistic life would increase. He would have to accept a material body birth after birth. Therefore the \u003cem\u003eśāstras\u003c/em\u003e enjoin that one may have sexual intercourse only if married. Otherwise it is illicit. In our Kṛṣṇa consciousness society, we prohibit illicit sex, but not legal sex.

So in our Society we have eliminated all these things, and our Western students are becoming pure devotees of Kṛṣṇa.

Similarly, there is certainly some pleasure in sex life, but what is the value of that pleasure? Compared to the unlimited pleasure of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it is like one drop of water in the desert. Everyone is seeking unlimited pleasure, but no one is becoming satisfied. They are having sex in so many different ways, and the young girls walking on the street are almost naked. The whole society has become degraded. Now the female population has increased everywhere, and every woman and girl is trying to attract a man. The men take advantage of the situation. There is a saying in Bengal: “When milk is available in the marketplace, what is the use of keeping a cow?” So men are declining to keep a wife because sex is so cheap.

The only way to entirely give up these lower pleasures is to take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. As Kṛṣṇa states in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e [2.59], \u003cem\u003eparaṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate:\u003c/em\u003e “By experiencing a higher taste, he is fixed in consciousness.” And as Yāmunācārya said, “Since I have been engaged in the transcendental loving service of Kṛṣṇa, realizing ever-new pleasure in Him, whenever I think of sex pleasure I spit at the thought, and my lips curl in distaste.” That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Our prescription is that in the beginning of life the child should be taught self-restraint (\u003cem\u003ebrahmacarya\u003c/em\u003e) and when he is past twenty he can marry. In the beginning he should learn how to restrain his senses. If a child is taught to become saintly, his semen rises to his brain, and he is able to understand spiritual values. Wasting semen decreases intelligence. So from the beginning, if he is a \u003cem\u003ebrahmacārī\u003c/em\u003e and does not misuse his semen, then he will become intelligent and strong and fully grown.3c:T450,For want of this education, everyone’s brain and bodily growth are being stunted.

But because he then has full strength of body and brain, he will immediately beget a male child. And because he has been trained from childhood to renounce materialistic enjoyment, when he is fifty years old he can retire from household life. At that time naturally his firstborn child will be twenty-five years old, and he can take responsibility for maintaining the household. Household life is simply a license for sex life – that’s all.

If I falsely identify with this body because of false ego, then anything based on this false idea is also false. This is called \u003cem\u003emāyā,\u003c/em\u003e or illusion.

All his troubles are due to the false ego, and as soon as the individual realizes his true ego, the blazing fire of material existence is immediately extinguished.

They may attempt to make him happy within the fire, but how can they be successful? He must be saved from the fire. Then he will be happy.

Nowadays, unqualified men have taken the presidential post. And although they may pose themselves as very religious, they are simply rascals. Why? Because under their noses thousands of cows are being killed, while they collect a good salary. Any leader who is at all religious should resign his post in protest if cow slaughter goes on under his rule. Since people do not know that these administrators are rascals, they are suffering. And the people are also rascals because they are voting for these bigger rascals. It is Plato’s view that the government should be ideal, and this is the ideal: The saintly philosophers should be at the head of the state; according to their advice the politicians should rule; under the protection of the politicians, the productive class should provide the necessities of life; and the laborer class should help.

You cannot find pure goodness (\u003cem\u003eśuddha-sattva\u003c/em\u003e) in this material world, for pure goodness is the transcendental platform. To come to the platform of pure goodness, which is the ideal, one has to undergo austerities (\u003cem\u003etapasā brahmacaryeṇa śamena ca damena ca\u003c/em\u003e).

If one becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious, all the good qualities automatically develop in him. Automatically he leads a life of celibacy, controls his mind and senses, and has a charitable disposition. In this age of Kali, people cannot possibly be trained to engage in austerity. Formerly, a \u003cem\u003ebrahmacārī\u003c/em\u003e [celibate student] would undergo austere training.

If one is naturally inclined to philosophical study, why should he waste his time in the military?

Economic production in America has no comparison in the world, yet still people are dissatisfied. The young men are confused.

It is animalistic to think that simply by increasing production everyone will become satisfied. Real happiness does not depend on either production or starvation, but upon peace of mind. For example, if a child is crying but the mother does not know why, the child will not stop simply by giving him some milk. Sometimes this actually happens: the mother cannot understand why her child is crying, and though she is giving him her breast, he continues to cry. Similarly, dissatisfaction in human society is not caused solely by low economic production. That is nonsense. There are many causes of dissatisfaction. The practical example is America, where there is sufficient production of everything, yet the young men are becoming hippies. They are dissatisfied, confused. No, simply by increasing economic production people will not become satisfied. Marx’s knowledge is insufficient.

These two things must be there: an enjoyer and a worker. For example, in our body the stomach is the enjoyer and all other parts of the body are workers. So this system is natural: there must always be someone who is the enjoyer and someone who is the worker. It is present in the capitalist system also. In Russia there is always conflict between the managers and the workers. The workers say, “If this is a classless society, why is that man sitting comfortably and ordering us to work?” The Russians have not been able to avoid this dilemma, and it cannot be avoided. There \u003cem\u003emust\u003c/em\u003e be one class of men who are the directors or enjoyers and another class of men who are the workers. Therefore the only way to have a truly classless society is to find that method by which both the managers and the workers will feel equal happiness. For example, if the stomach is hungry and the eyes see some food, immediately the brain will say, “O legs, please go there!” and “Hand, pick it up,” and “Now please put it into the mouth.” Immediately the food goes into the stomach, and as soon as the stomach is satisfied, the eyes are satisfied, the legs are satisfied, and the hand is satisfied.48:T51a,If you simply pour water on the root of a tree, all the branches, twigs, leaves, and flowers will be nourished. Similarly, everyone can be satisfied simply by \u003cem\u003eacyutejyā. Acyuta\u003c/em\u003e means Kṛṣṇa, and \u003cem\u003eijyā\u003c/em\u003e means worship. So this is the formula for a classless society: Make Kṛṣṇa [God] the center and do everything for Him. There are no classes in our International Society for Krishna Consciousness.

In Vṛndāvana, some are cowherd boys, some are cows, some are trees, some are fathers, some are mothers, but the center is Kṛṣṇa, and everyone is satisfied simply by loving Him.

Why is that?” The king then called his minister in and also had someone bring in an elephant. “Please take this elephant and weigh it,” the king said to his workers. The workers took the elephant to all the markets, but they could not find a scale large enough to weigh the animal. When they returned to the palace the king asked, “What happened?” One of the workers answered, “Sir, we could not find a scale large enough to weigh the elephant.” Then the king addressed his prime minister, “Will you please weigh this elephant?” “Yes, sir,” said the prime minister, and he took the elephant away. He returned within a few minutes and said, “It weighs 11,650 pounds.” All the workers were astonished. “How did you weigh the elephant so quickly?” one of them asked. “Did you find some very large scale?” The minister replied, “No. It is impossible to weigh an elephant on a scale. I went to the river, took the elephant on a boat, and noted the watermark. After taking the elephant off the boat, I put weights in the boat until the same watermark was reached. Then I had the elephant’s weight.” The king said to his workers, “Now do you see the difference?” One who has intelligence has strength, not the fools and the rascals.

Because they have no idea of the pleasure of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the materialists regard sex as the highest pleasure. And how is it actually experienced?

The mother has to undergo labor pains, and the father has to take responsibility for raising the children nicely and giving them an education. Of course, if one is irresponsible like cats and dogs, that is another thing. But for those who are actually gentlemen, is it not painful to bear and raise children? Certainly.

In our Kṛṣṇa consciousness society, we prohibit illicit sex, but not legal sex. In the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e [7.11] Kṛṣṇa says, \u003cem\u003edharmāviruddho bhūteṣu kamo ’smi bharatarṣabha:\u003c/em\u003e “I am sexual intercourse that is not against religious principles.” This means that sex must be regulated. Everyone has a tendency to have sex unrestrictedly – and in Western countries they are actually doing this – but according to the Vedic system, there must be restrictions. And not only must sex be restricted, but meat-eating, gambling, and drinking as well. So in our Society we have eliminated all these things, and our Western students are becoming pure devotees of Kṛṣṇa.

Sex is not required, but one who cannot restrain himself is given a license to get married and have sex. This is the real program that will save society. By speculating on some shock that may or may not have occurred in childhood, one will never discover the root disease. The sex impulse, as well as the impulse to become intoxicated and to eat meat, is present from the very beginning of life. Therefore one must restrain himself.

The whole Vedic civilization is based on how one can cure this materialistic disease. If we can cure this disease, its symptoms will automatically vanish.
