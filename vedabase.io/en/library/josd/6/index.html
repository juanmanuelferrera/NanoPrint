simple, yet profound solution for world peace and harmony. Noting the increasing number of flags at the United Nations building in New York, he states that internationalism is failing because “your international feeling and my international feeling are overlapping and conflicting. We have to find the proper center for our loving feelings. … That center is Kṛṣṇa.”</em></div></div><div id="bb94795" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Thank you very much for participating with us in this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. I understand that this society is known as the International Student Society. There are many other international societies, such as the United Nations. So the idea of an international society is very nice, but we must try to understand what the central idea of an international society should be.</div></div><div id="bb94796" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">If you throw a stone into the middle of a pool of water, a circle will expand to the limit of the bank. Similarly, radio waves expand in a circle, and when you capture the waves with your radio you can hear the message. In the same way, our loving feeling can also expand.</div></div><div id="bb94797" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">At the beginning of our life, we simply want to eat. Whatever a small child grabs, he wants to eat. He has only personal interest. Then, when the child grows a little, he tries to participate with his brothers and sisters: “All right. You also take a little.” This is an increase in the feeling of fellowship. Then, as he grows up, he begins to feel some love for his parents, then for his community, then for his country, and at last for all nations. But unless the center is right, that expansion of feeling – even if it is national or international – is not perfect.</div></div><div id="bb94798" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">For example, the meaning of the word <em>national</em> is “one who has taken birth in a particular country.” You feel for other Americans because they are born in this country. You may even sacrifice your life for your countrymen. But there is a defect: If the definition of <em>national</em> is “one who is born in a particular country,” then why are the animals born in America not considered Americans? The problem is that we are not expanding our feelings beyond the human society. Because we don’t think animals are our countrymen, we send them to the slaughterhouse.</div></div><div id="bb94799" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So the center of our national feeling or our international feeling is not fixed on the proper object. If the center is right, then you can draw any number of circles around that center and they’ll never overlap. They’ll simply keep growing, growing, growing. They’ll not intersect with one another if the center is all right. Unfortunately, although everyone is feeling nationally or internationally, the center is missing. Therefore your international feeling and my international feeling, your national feeling and my national feeling, are overlapping and conflicting. So we have to find the proper center for our loving feelings. Then you can expand your circle of feelings and it will not overlap or conflict with others’.</div></div><div id="bb94800" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">That center is Kṛṣṇa.</div></div><div id="bb94801" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Our society, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, is teaching the people of all countries that the center of their affection should be Kṛṣṇa. In other words, we are teaching people to be <em>mahātmās.</em> You may have heard this word <em>mahātmā</em> before. It is a Sanskrit word that is applied to a person whose mind is expanded, whose circle of feelings is very much expanded. This is a <em>mahātmā. Mahā</em> means “big” or “great,” and <em>ātmā</em> means “soul.” So he who has expanded his soul very wide is called a <em>mahātmā.</em></div></div><div id="bb94802" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> [7.19] gives a description of the person who has expanded his feelings very wide:</div></div><div id="bb94803" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic"><em>bahūnāṁ janmanām ante<br />jñānavān māṁ prapadyate<br /> vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti<br />sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ</em></div></div><div id="bb94804" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The first idea in this verse is that one can become a <em>mahātmā</em> only after many, many births (<em>bahūnāṁ janmanām ante</em>). The soul is transmigrating through many bodies, one after another. There are 8,400,000 different species of life, and we evolve through them until at last we come to the human form of life. Only then can we become a <em>mahātmā.</em> This is why Kṛṣṇa says <em>bahūnāṁ janmanām ante:</em> “After many, many births one may become a <em>mahātmā.</em>”</div></div><div id="bb94805" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> there is a similar verse. <em>Labdhvā su-durlabham idaṁ bahu-sambhavānte:</em> “After many, many births you have achieved a human body, which is very difficult to get.” This human form of life is not cheap. The bodies of cats and dogs and other animals are cheap, but this human form is not. After being born in at least 8,000,000 different species, we get this human form. So the <em>Bhāgavatam</em> and the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> say the same thing. All Vedic literatures corroborate one another, and the person who can understand them doesn’t find any contradiction.</div></div><div id="bb94806" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So the human form of life is obtained after many, many births in other-than-human forms of life. But even in this human form of life, many, many births are required for one who is cultivating knowledge of the central point of existence. If one is actually cultivating spiritual knowledge – not in one life but in many, many lives – one eventually comes to the highest platform of knowledge and is called<em> jñānavān,</em> “the possessor of true knowledge.” Then, Kṛṣṇa says, <em>māṁ prapadyate:</em> “He surrenders unto Me, Kṛṣṇa, or God.” (When I say “Kṛṣṇa” I mean the Supreme Lord, the all-attractive Supreme Personality of Godhead.)</div></div><div id="bb94807" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now, why does a man in knowledge surrender to Kṛṣṇa? <em>Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti:</em> Because he knows that Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa, is everything – that He is the central point of all loving feelings. Then, <em>sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ.</em> Here the word <em>mahātmā</em> is used. After cultivating knowledge for many, many births, a person who expands his consciousness up to the point of loving God – he is a <em>mahātmā,</em> a great soul. God is great, and His devotee is also great. But, Kṛṣṇa says, <em>sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ:</em> That sort of great soul is very rarely to be seen. This is the description of a <em>mahātmā</em> we get from the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>.</div></div><div id="bb94808" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now we have expanded our feelings of love to various objects.

But, the <em>Bhāgavatam</em> says, if by performing your duties very nicely you still do not come to the understanding of Kṛṣṇa, then whatever you have done is simply useless labor (<em>śrama eva hi kevalam</em>).

From the highborn <em>brāhmaṇa</em> down to the <em>caṇḍāla</em> [outcaste], there are many social classes in human society, but if a man is really learned he sees everyone, every living entity, on the same level.

That is our natural function – to expand our consciousness. But my point is that if we actually want to expand our consciousness to the utmost, we must find out the real center of existence. That center is Kṛṣṇa, or God. How do we know Kṛṣṇa is God? Kṛṣṇa declares Himself to be God in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>. Please always remember that the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is based on understanding <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> as it is. Whatever I am speaking is in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>. Unfortunately, the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> has been misinterpreted by so many commentators that people have misunderstood it. Actually, the purport of the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> is to develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness, love of Kṛṣṇa, and we are trying to teach that.</div></div><div id="bb94816" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> Kṛṣṇa has given several descriptions of a <em>mahātmā.</em> He says, <em>mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ:</em> “A <em>mahātmā,</em> one who is actually wise and broad-minded, is under the shelter of My spiritual energy.” He is no longer under the spell of the material energy.</div></div><div id="bb94817" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Whatever we see is made up of various energies of God.

For example, we have all seen a blooming flower. We may think that it has automatically blossomed and become so beautiful.

And a <em>mahātmā,</em> one who is broad-minded, is under the protection of that spiritual energy; he is not under the spell of the material energy. These things are all explained in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>. There are many verses in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> that describe how Kṛṣṇa’s energies are working, and our mission is to present <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> as it is, without any nonsensical commentary. There is no need of nonsensical commentary. <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> is as clear as the sunlight. Just as you don’t require a lamp to see the sun, you don’t require the commentary of an ignorant, common man to study the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>. You should study the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> as it is. Then you will get all spiritual knowledge. You will become wise and will understand Kṛṣṇa.

A <em>mahātmā</em> is under the protection of Kṛṣṇa’s spiritual energy, but what is the symptom of that protection? Kṛṣṇa says, <em>mām … bhajanty ananya-manasaḥ:</em> “A <em>mahātmā</em> is always engaged in devotional service to Me.” That is the main symptom of a <em>mahātmā:</em> he is always serving Kṛṣṇa. Does he engage in this devotional service blindly? No. Kṛṣṇa says, <em>jñātvā bhūtādim avyayam:</em> “He knows perfectly that I am the source of everything.”</div></div><div id="bb94820" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So Kṛṣṇa explains everything in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>.

Then the human society will profit from this knowledge. Now society is not in a sound condition, but if people understand the <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> and if they actually broaden their outlook, all social, national, and international problems will be solved automatically. There will be no difficulty. But if we don’t find out what the center of existence is, if we manufacture our own ways to expand our loving feelings, there will be only conflict – not only between individual persons but between the different nations of the world. The nations are trying to be united; in your country there is the United Nations. Unfortunately, instead of the nations becoming united, the flags are increasing. Similarly, India was once one country, Hindustan. Now there is also Pakistan.

But I, the spirit soul, am part and parcel of the supreme father, Kṛṣṇa.

None of us can say, “Simply by glancing over my wife, I can make her pregnant.” But although this is impossible for us, it is not impossible for Kṛṣṇa. The <em>Brahma-saṁhitā</em> [5.32] says, <em>aṅgāni yasya sakalendriya-vṛttimanti:</em> Every part of Kṛṣṇa’s body has all the capabilities of the other parts.

There is no need of sex, for simply by glancing Kṛṣṇa can create pregnancy.</div></div><div id="bb94847" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> [9.10] Lord Kṛṣṇa says, <em>mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram:</em> “By My supervision, material nature gives birth to all moving and nonmoving beings.” The word <em>akṣa</em> means “eyes,” so <em>akṣeṇa</em> indicates that all living entities take birth because of the Lord’s glance. There are two kinds of living entities – the moving beings, like insects, animals, and human beings, and the nonmoving beings, like trees and plants. In Sanskrit these two kinds of living entities are called <em>sthāvara-jaṅgama,</em> and they both come forth from material nature.</div></div><div id="bb94848" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Of course, what comes from material nature is not the life, but the body. The living entities accept particular types of bodies from material nature, just as a child takes its body from its mother. For ten months the child’s body develops from the blood and nutrients of the mother’s body, but the child is a living entity, not matter. It is the living entity that has taken shelter in the womb of the mother, who then supplies the ingredients for that living entity’s body. This is nature’s way. The mother may not know how from her body another body has been created, but when the body of the child is fit, the child takes birth.</div></div><div id="bb94849" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">It is not that the living entity takes birth. As stated in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> [2.20], <em>na jāyate mriyate vā:</em> The living entity neither takes birth nor dies. That which does not take birth does not die; death is meant for that which has been created, and that which is not created has no death. The <em>Gītā</em> says, <em>na jāyate mriyate vā kadācit.</em> The word <em>kadācit</em> means “at any time.” At no time does the living entity actually take birth. Although we may see that a child is born, actually it is not born. <em>Nityaḥ śāśvato ’yaṁ purāṇaḥ.</em> The living entity is eternal (<em>śāśvata</em>), always existing, and very, very old (<em>purāṇa</em>). <em>Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre:</em> Don’t think that when the body is destroyed the living entity will be destroyed; no, the living entity will continue to exist.</div></div><div id="bb94850" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">A scientist friend once asked me, “What is the proof of the soul’s eternality?” Kṛṣṇa says, <em>na hanyate hanyamāne śārīre:</em> “The soul is not killed when the body is killed.” This statement in itself is proof. This type of proof is called <em>śruti,</em> the proof established by that which is heard through the disciplic succession from the Supreme. One form of proof is proof by logic (<em>nyāya-prasthāna</em>). One can get knowledge by logic, arguments, and philosophical research. But another form of proof is <em>śruti,</em> proof established by hearing from authorities. A third form of proof is <em>smṛti,</em> proof established by statements derived from the <em>śruti.</em> The <em>Purāṇas</em> are <em>smṛti,</em> the <em>Upaniṣads</em> are <em>śruti,</em> and the <em>Vedānta</em> is <em>nyāya.</em> Of these three the <em>śruti-prasthāna,</em> or the evidence from the <em>śruti,</em> is especially important.</div></div><div id="bb94851" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><em>Pratyakṣa,</em> the process of receiving knowledge through direct perception, has no value, because our senses are all imperfect. For example, to us the sun looks like a small disk, but in fact it is many times larger than the earth. So what is the value of our direct perception through our eyes? We have so many senses through which we can experience knowledge – the eyes, the ears, the nose, and so on – but because these senses are imperfect, whatever knowledge we get by exercising these senses is also imperfect. Because scientists try to understand things by exercising their imperfect senses, their conclusions are always imperfect. Svarūpa Dāmodara, a scientist among our disciples, inquired from a fellow scientist who says that life comes from matter, “If I give you the chemicals with which to produce life, will you be able to produce it?” The scientist replied, “That I do not know.” This is imperfect knowledge. If you do not know, then your knowledge is imperfect. Why then have you become a teacher? That is cheating.

The oyster produces pearls, and formerly people decorated their bodies with pearls, valuable stones, silk, gold, and silver. But where are those things now? Now, with the advancement of civilization, there are so many beautiful girls who have no ornaments of gold, pearls, or jewels, but only plastic bangles.

By nature’s way the water in the ocean is kept clear like crystal, and the same water is transferred to the rivers, but without salt, so that one may take nice water from the river. This is nature’s way, and nature’s way means Kṛṣṇa’s way.

Otherwise, we need only depend on Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa’s mercy, because by Kṛṣṇa’s glance (<em>tava vīkṣitaiḥ</em>), everything is set right. So if we simply plead for Kṛṣṇa’s glance, there will be no question of scarcity or need. Everything will be complete.

Perhaps in the city, although not very often. But if we go to the jungle we shall see that all the elephants, lions, tigers, and other animals are very stout and strong. Who is supplying them with food?

Therefore the tiger has difficulty finding food. And as soon as the tiger is out, there is an animal that follows it and makes a sound like <em>“fayo, fayo,”</em> so that the other animals will know, “Now the tiger is out.” So by nature’s way the tiger has difficulty. But still Kṛṣṇa supplies it food. After about a week, the tiger will get the chance to catch an animal, and because it does not get fresh food daily, it will keep the carcass in some bush and eat a little at a time. Since the tiger is very powerful, people want to become like a lion or a tiger. But that is not a very good proposition, because if one actually becomes like a tiger one won’t get food daily, but will have to search for food with great labor. If one becomes a vegetarian, however, one will get food every day.

Still, for that daily slice of meat they kill so many poor animals. How sinful this is! If people commit such sinful activities, how can they be happy? This killing should not be done, but because it is being done people are unhappy.

Now if You like You may kill me, or else You may give me protection.” And Kṛṣṇa says in reply, “Yes. <em>Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja:</em> Simply surrender exclusively unto Me.” He does not say, “Yes, depend on Me, and also depend on your slaughterhouses and factories.” No. He says, “Depend only on Me. <em>Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi:</em> I will rescue you from the results of your sinful activities.”</div></div><div id="bb94861" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Because we have lived so many years without being Kṛṣṇa conscious, we have lived only a sinful life, but Kṛṣṇa assures us that as soon as one surrenders to Him, He immediately squares all accounts and puts an end to all one’s sinful activities so that one may begin a new life.

That is the greatest offense (<em>nāmno balād yasya hi pāpa-buddhiḥ</em>). The members of some religious orders go to church and confess their sins, but then they again commit the same sinful activities. What, then, is the value of their confession? One may confess, “My Lord, out of my ignorance I committed this sin.” But one should not plan, “I shall commit sinful activities and then go to church and confess them, and then the sins will be nullified and I can begin a new chapter of sinful life.” Similarly, one should not knowingly take advantage of the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa <em>mantra</em> to nullify sinful activities so that one may then begin sinful acts again. We should be very careful. Before taking initiation, one promises to have no illicit sex, no intoxicants, no gambling, and no meat-eating, and this vow one should strictly follow. Then one will be clean. If one keeps oneself clean in this way and always engages in devotional service, his life will be a success, and there will be no scarcity of anything he wants.</div></div><div id="bb94863" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">Spiritual Advice to Businessmen</h2></div><div id="bb94864" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify italic"><em>On January 30, 1973, in Calcutta, Śrīla Prabhupāda speaks to the Bharata Chamber of Commerce, a group of the region’s leading businessmen. “We should not be satisfied with becoming a big businessman.

But if you simply do business and do not cultivate your spiritual life, then your business is a useless waste of time (<em>śrama eva hi kevalam</em>).</div></div><div id="bb94888" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is being spread so that you do not forget your cultural life. We do not say that you stop your business and become a <em>sannyāsī</em> like me and give up everything. We do not say that. Nor did Kṛṣṇa say that. Kṛṣṇa never said, “Arjuna, give up your fighting business.” No, He said, “Arjuna, you are a <em>kṣatriya.</em> You are declining to fight, saying, `Oh, it is very abominable.’ You should not say that. You <em>must</em> fight.” That was Kṛṣṇa’s instruction.</div></div><div id="bb94889" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Similarly, we Kṛṣṇa conscious people are also advising everyone, “Don’t give up your business.

But to cultivate spiritual knowledge while one stays in his position – that is required. Among the animals there is no cultivation of spiritual life. That is not possible; the animals cannot cultivate this knowledge. Therefore, if human beings do not cultivate spiritual knowledge, they’re exactly like animals (<em>dharmeṇa hīnāḥ paśubhiḥ samānāḥ</em>).</div></div><div id="bb94890" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So we should be very conscious about our eternal existence. We, the spirit soul within the body, are eternal (<em>na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</em>). We are not going to die after the annihilation of our body. This is the cultivation of knowledge, or <em>brahma-jijñāsā,</em> which means inquiry about one’s self. Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s first disciple, Sanātana Gosvāmī, was formerly finance minister in the government of Nawab Hussein Shah. Then he retired and approached Caitanya Mahāprabhu and humbly said, “My dear Lord, people call me <em>paṇḍita.</em>” (Because he was a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> by caste, naturally he was called <em>paṇḍita,</em> meaning “a learned person.”) “But I am such a <em>paṇḍita,</em>” he said, “that I do not even know who or what I am.”</div></div><div id="bb94891" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">This is the position of everyone.

Therefore we accept <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> as <em>śāstra</em> [revealed scripture]. The compiler of <em>śāstra</em> (the <em>śāstra-kāra</em>) must be a liberated person so that he can describe past, present, and future.</div></div><div id="bb94915" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> you will find many things which are foretold. There is mention of Lord Buddha’s appearance and Lord Kalki’s appearance. (Lord Kalki will appear at the end of the Kali-yuga.) There is also mention of Lord Caitanya’s appearance. Although the <em>Bhāgavatam</em> was written five thousand years ago, the writer knew past, present, and future (<em>tri-kāla-jña</em>), and thus he could predict all these events with perfect accuracy.</div></div><div id="bb94916" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So here Śukadeva Gosvāmī is describing the chief symptoms of this age. He says, <em>tataś cānu-dinam:</em> With the progress of this age [Kali-yuga], <em>dharma,</em> religious principles; <em>satyam,</em> truthfulness; <em>śaucam,</em> cleanliness; <em>kṣamā,</em> forgiveness; <em>dayā,</em> mercifulness; <em>āyuḥ,</em> duration of life; <em>balam,</em> bodily strength; <em>smṛti,</em> memory – these eight things will gradually decrease to nil or almost nil.</div></div><div id="bb94917" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Of course, there are other <em>yugas</em> besides Kali-yuga. During the Satya-yuga, which lasted eighteen hundred thousand years, human beings lived for one hundred thousand years. The duration of the next age, the Tretā-yuga, was twelve hundred thousand years, and the people of that age used to live for ten thousand years. In other words, the duration of life was ten times reduced. In the next age, Dvāpara-yuga, the life span was again ten times reduced – people used to live for one thousand years – and the duration of the Dvāpara Age was eight hundred thousand years. Then, in the next age, this Kali-yuga, we can live up to one hundred years at the utmost. We are not living one hundred years, but still, the limit is one hundred years. So just see: from one hundred years the average duration of life has decreased to about seventy years. And it will eventually decrease to the point where if a man lives for twenty to thirty years, he will be considered a very old man.</div></div><div id="bb94918" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Another symptom of the Kali-yuga predicted in the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> is the decrease in memory (<em>smṛti</em>). We see nowadays that people do not have very sharp memories – they forget easily. They may hear something daily, yet still they forget it. Similarly, bodily strength (<em>balam</em>) is decreasing. You can all understand this, because you know that your father or grandfather was physically stronger than you are. So, bodily strength is decreasing, memory is decreasing, and the duration of life is decreasing – and all of this is predicted in <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em>.</div></div><div id="bb94919" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Another symptom of Kali-yuga is the decrease in religion. There is practically no question of religion in this age – it has almost decreased to nil. No one is interested in religion. The churches and temples are being closed, locked up. The building we are sitting in was once a church, but it was sold because no one was coming. Similarly, we are purchasing a very big church in Australia, and in London I have seen many hundreds of vacant churches – no one is going there. And not only churches: in India also, except for a few important temples, the ordinary, small temples are being closed. They have become the habitation of the dogs. So <em>dharma,</em> religion, is decreasing.</div></div><div id="bb94920" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Truthfulness, cleanliness, and forgiveness are also decreasing. Formerly, if someone did something wrong, the other party would forgive him. For example, Arjuna was tortured by his enemies, yet still, on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra he said, “Kṛṣṇa, let me leave. I don’t want to kill them.” This is forgiveness. But now, even for a small insult people will kill. This is going on. Also, there is now no mercifulness (<em>dayā</em>). Even if you see someone being killed in front of you, you will not take interest. These things are happening already. So, religion, truthfulness, cleanliness, forgiveness, mercifulness, duration of life, bodily strength, and memory – these eight things will decrease, decrease, decrease, decrease. When you see these symptoms, you should know the age of Kali is making progress.</div></div><div id="bb94921" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Another symptom is <em>vittam eva kalau nṝṇāṁ janmācāra-guṇodayaḥ:</em> “In Kali-yuga, a man’s qualities and social position will be calculated according to the extent of his wealth.” [<a href="/en/library/sb/12/2/2/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> 12.2.2</a>] Formerly a man’s position was calculated according to his spiritual understanding. For example, a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> was honored because he knew <em>brahma –</em> he was aware of the Supreme Spirit. But now in Kali-yuga there are actually no <em>brāhmaṇas,</em> because people are taking the title of <em>brāhmaṇa</em> simply by <em>janma,</em> or birthright. Previously there was also birthright, but one was actually known according to his behavior. If a man was born in a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> family or a <em>kṣatriya</em> [administrative or military] family, he had to behave like a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> or <em>kṣatriya.</em> And it was the king’s duty to see that no one was falsely representing himself. In other words, respectability was awarded according to culture and education. But nowadays, <em>vittam eva kalau nṝṇām:</em> if you get money somehow or other, then everything is available. You may be a third-class or a fourth-class or a tenth-class man, but if you get money somehow or other, then you are very much respected. There is no question of your culture or education or knowledge. This is Kali-yuga.</div></div><div id="bb94922" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Another symptom of Kali-yuga: <em>dharma-nyāya-vyavasthāyāṁ kāraṇaṁ balam eva hi.</em> “Religious principles and justice will be determined by a show of strength.” [<a href="/en/library/sb/12/2/2/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> 12.2.2</a>] If you have some influence, then everything will be decided in your favor. You may be the most irreligious person, but if you can bribe a priest he will certify that you are religious. So character will be decided by money, not by actual qualification. Next is <em>dāmpatye ’bhirucir hetur māyaiva vyāvahārike:</em> “Marriages will be arranged according to temporary affection, and to be a successful businessman, one will have to cheat.” [<a href="/en/library/sb/12/2/3/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> 12.2.3</a>] The relationship between husband and wife will depend on <em>abhiruci,</em> their liking each other. If a girl likes a boy and a boy likes a girl, then they think, “All right, now let the marriage take place.” No one ever knows what the future of the girl and boy will be. Therefore everyone becomes unhappy. Six months after marriage – divorce. This is because the marriage took place simply on the basis of superficial liking, not deep understanding.</div></div><div id="bb94923" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Formerly, at least in India during my time, marriages did not take place because the boy and girl liked each other. No. Marriages were decided by the parents. I married when I was a student, but I did not know who my wife would be; my parents arranged everything. Another example is Dr. Rajendra Prasada, the first president of India. In his biography he wrote that he married at the age of eight. Similarly, my father-in-law married when he was eleven years old, and my mother-in-law when she was seven. So the point is that formerly, in India, marriage took place only after an astrological calculation of past, present, and future had determined whether the couple would be happy in their life together. When marriage is thus sanctified, the man and the woman live peacefully and practice spiritual culture. Each one helps the other, so they live very happily and become advanced in spiritual life. And at last they go back home, back to Godhead. That is the system. Not that a grown-up girl and a grown-up boy mix together, and if he likes her and she likes him they get married, and then he leaves or she leaves … This kind of marriage was not sanctioned. But of this Kali-yuga it is said, <em>dāmpatye ’bhiruciḥ:</em> Marriage will take place simply because of mutual liking, that’s all. Liking one moment means disliking the next moment. That is a fact.

These three qualities of the living being are minutely visible in human society, but they are increased and enjoyed one hundred times more by the beings who reside in the upper planets, which are called Bhūrloka, Svarloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, Maharloka, Brahmaloka, and so forth.</div></div><div id="bb94993" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">But even the standard of enjoyment on the highest planet in the material world, which is thousands and thousands of times superior to what we enjoy on this earth, is also described as insignificant in comparison to the spiritual bliss enjoyed in the company of the Supreme Lord.

Therefore, the living entity must be given a different type of happiness, a transcendental happiness, which is called spiritual bliss.

That is the law of nature. If money is not devoted to the service of the Lord, by the law of nature it must be spent as spoiled energy in the fight against legal problems, diseases, and so on.

If he takes more salt he spoils the broth, and if he takes less salt his eatables become tasteless.

Now society is not in a sound condition, but if people understand the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā,\u003c/em\u003e and if they actually broaden their outlook, all social, national, and international problems will be solved "])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"automatically. There will be no difficulty. But if we don’t find out what the center of existence is, if we manufacture our own ways to expand our loving feelings, there will be only conflict – not only between individual persons but between the different nations of the world. The nations are trying to be united; in your country there is the United Nations. Unfortunately, instead of the nations becoming united, the flags are increasing. Similarly, India was once one country, Hindustan. Now there is also Pakistan. And some time in the future there will be Sikhistan and then some other “stan.”2e:T43c,Similarly, the whole material creation is due to Kṛṣṇa’s glance (\u003cem\u003esa aikṣata\u003c/em\u003e). In the \u003cem\u003eVedas\u003c/em\u003e it is said that He glanced over matter, thus agitating it. A woman in touch with a man becomes agitated and becomes pregnant and then gives birth to children. The whole creation follows a similar process. Simply by Kṛṣṇa’s glance, matter becomes agitated and then becomes pregnant and gives birth to the living entities. It is simply by His glance that plants, trees, animals, and all other living beings come forth. How is this possible? None of us can say, “Simply by glancing over my wife, I can make her pregnant.” But although this is impossible for us, it is not impossible for Kṛṣṇa. The \u003cem\u003eBrahma-saṁhitā\u003c/em\u003e [5.32] says, \u003cem\u003eaṅgāni yasya sakalendriya-vṛttimanti:\u003c/em\u003e Every part of Kṛṣṇa’s body has all the capabilities of the other parts. With our eyes we can only see, but Kṛṣṇa can make others pregnant merely by looking at them. There is no need of sex, for simply by glancing Kṛṣṇa can create pregnancy.2f:T477,\u003cem\u003ePratyakṣa,\u003c/em\u003e the process of receiving knowledge through direct perception, has no value, because our senses are all imperfect. For example, to us the sun looks like a small disk, but in fact it is many times larger than the earth. So what is the value of our direct perception through our eyes? We have so many senses through which w"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"e can experience knowledge – the eyes, the ears, the nose, and so on – but because these senses are imperfect, whatever knowledge we get by exercising these senses is also imperfect. Because scientists try to understand things by exercising their imperfect senses, their conclusions are always imperfect. Svarūpa Dāmodara, a scientist among our disciples, inquired from a fellow scientist who says that life comes from matter, “If I give you the chemicals with which to produce life, will you be able to produce it?” The scientist replied, “That I do not know.” This is imperfect knowledge. If you do not know, then your knowledge is imperfect. Why then have you become a teacher? That is cheating. Our contention is that to become perfect one must take lessons from the perfect teacher.30:T467,Of course, by nature’s way the tiger, being a nonvegetarian, does not get food every day. After all, who will face a tiger to become its food? Who will say to the tiger, “Sir, I am an altruist and have come to you to give you food, so take my body”? No one. Therefore the tiger has difficulty finding food. And as soon as the tiger is out, there is an animal that follows it and makes a sound like \u003cem\u003e“fayo, fayo,”\u003c/em\u003e so that the other animals will know, “Now the tiger is out.” So by nature’s way the tiger has difficulty. But still Kṛṣṇa supplies it food. After about a week, the tiger will get the chance to catch an animal, and because it does not get fresh food daily, it will keep the carcass in some bush and eat a little at a time. Since the tiger is very powerful, people want to become like a lion or a tiger. But that is not a very good proposition, because if one actually becomes like a tiger one won’t get food daily, but will have to search for food with great labor. If one becomes a vegetarian, however, one will get food every day. The food for a vegetarian is available everywhere.31:T4d5,One should not think that because the holy name of Kṛṣṇa can nullify sinful activities, one may co"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"mmit a little sinful activity and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa to nullify it. That is the greatest offense (\u003cem\u003enāmno balād yasya hi pāpa-buddhiḥ\u003c/em\u003e). The members of some religious orders go to church and confess their sins, but then they again commit the same sinful activities. What, then, is the value of their confession? One may confess, “My Lord, out of my ignorance I committed this sin.” But one should not plan, “I shall commit sinful activities and then go to church and confess them, and then the sins will be nullified and I can begin a new chapter of sinful life.” Similarly, one should not knowingly take advantage of the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa \u003cem\u003emantra\u003c/em\u003e to nullify sinful activities so that one may then begin sinful acts again. We should be very careful. Before taking initiation, one promises to have no illicit sex, no intoxicants, no gambling, and no meat-eating, and this vow one should strictly follow. Then one will be clean. If one keeps oneself clean in this way and always engages in devotional service, his life will be a success, and there will be no scarcity of anything he wants.32:T502,For the neophytes, Kṛṣṇa says, \u003cem\u003eraso ’ham apsu kaunteya prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ:\u003c/em\u003e “My dear Kaunteya, I am the taste of water, and I am the light of the sun and the moon.” There is no need to say, “I cannot see God.” Here is God: the taste of water is God. Everyone drinks water, and when one tastes it he is perceiving God. Then why do you say, “I cannot see God”? Think as God directs, and then gradually you’ll see Him. Simply remember this one instruction from \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e – \u003cem\u003eraso ’ham apsu kaunteya prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ:\u003c/em\u003e “I am the taste of water; I am the shining illumination of the sun and moon.” Who has not seen the sunlight? Who has not seen the moonlight? Who has not tasted water? Then why do you say, “I have not seen God”?

For example, a \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa\u003c/em\u003e was honored because he knew \u003cem\u003ebrahma –\u003c/em\u003e he was aware of the Supreme Spirit. But now in Kali-yuga there are actually no \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇas,\u003c/em\u003e because people are taking the title of \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa\u003c/em\u003e simply by \u003cem\u003ejanma,\u003c/em\u003e or birthright. Previously there was also birthright, but one was actually known according to his behavior. If a man was born in a \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa\u003c/em\u003e family or a \u003cem\u003ekṣatriya\u003c/em\u003e [administrative or military] family, he had to behave like a \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003ekṣatriya.\u003c/em\u003e And it was the king’s duty to see that no one was falsely representing himself. In other words, respectability was awarded according to culture and education. But nowadays, \u003cem\u003evittam eva kalau nṝṇām:\u003c/em\u003e if you get money somehow or other, then everything is available. You may be a third-class or a fourth-class or a tenth-class man, but if you get money somehow or other, then you are very much respected. There is no question of your culture or education or knowledge. This is Kali-yuga.34:T4d5,Another symptom of Kali-yuga: \u003cem\u003edharma-nyāya-vyavasthāyāṁ kāraṇaṁ balam eva hi.\u003c/em\u003e “Religious principles and justice will be determined by a show of strength.” [\u003ca href=\"/en/library/sb/12/2/2/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavat"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"am\u003c/em\u003e 12.2.2\u003c/a\u003e] If you have some influence, then everything will be decided in your favor. You may be the most irreligious person, but if you can bribe a priest he will certify that you are religious. So character will be decided by money, not by actual qualification. Next is \u003cem\u003edāmpatye ’bhirucir hetur māyaiva vyāvahārike:\u003c/em\u003e “Marriages will be arranged according to temporary affection, and to be a successful businessman, one will have to cheat.” [\u003ca href=\"/en/library/sb/12/2/3/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e 12.2.3\u003c/a\u003e] The relationship between husband and wife will depend on \u003cem\u003eabhiruci,\u003c/em\u003e their liking each other. If a girl likes a boy and a boy likes a girl, then they think, “All right, now let the marriage take place.” No one ever knows what the future of the girl and boy will be. Therefore everyone becomes unhappy. Six months after marriage – divorce. This is because the marriage took place simply on the basis of superficial liking, not deep understanding.35:T58c,Formerly, at least in India during my time, marriages did not take place because the boy and girl liked each other. No. Marriages were decided by the parents. I married when I was a student, but I did not know who my wife would be; my parents arranged everything. Another example is Dr. Rajendra Prasada, the first president of India. In his biography he wrote that he married at the age of eight. Similarly, my father-in-law married when he was eleven years old, and my mother-in-law when she was seven. So the point is that formerly, in India, marriage took place only after an astrological calculation of past, present, and future had determined whether the couple would be happy in their life together. When marriage is thus sanctified, the man and the woman live peacefully and practice spiritual culture. Each one helps the other, so they live very happily and become advanced in spiritual life. And at last they go back home, back to Godhead. That is the system. Not that a grown-up girl and a grown-up boy mix together, and if he"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1," likes her and she likes him they get married, and then he leaves or she leaves … This kind of marriage was not sanctioned. But of this Kali-yuga it is said, \u003cem\u003edāmpatye ’bhiruciḥ:\u003c/em\u003e Marriage will take place simply because of mutual liking, that’s all. Liking one moment means disliking the next moment. That is a fact. So a marriage based on mutual liking has no value.36:T4c9,Another symptom of Kali-yuga is \u003cem\u003eavṛttyā nyāya-daurbalyaṁ pāṇḍitye cāpalaṁ vacaḥ:\u003c/em\u003e “Those without money will be unable to get justice, and anyone who can cleverly juggle words will be considered a scholar.” [\u003ca href=\"/en/library/sb/12/2/4/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e 12.2.4\u003c/a\u003e] If you have no money, then you will never get justice in court. This is Kali-yuga. Nowadays even the high-court judges are taking bribes to give you a favorable judgment. But if you have no money, then don’t go to court. And \u003cem\u003epāṇḍitye cāpalaṁ vacaḥ.\u003c/em\u003e If a man can talk expertly – it doesn’t matter what he says, and nobody has to understand it – then he is a \u003cem\u003epaṇḍita.\u003c/em\u003e He is a learned scholar.

[\u003cem\u003eLaughter.\u003c/em\u003e] Yet people will say, “Ah, see how learned he is.” [\u003cem\u003eLaughter.\u003c/em\u003e] This is actually happening. There are so many rascals writing books, but if you ask one of them to explain what he has understood, he’ll say, “Oh, it is inexplicable.” These things are going on.37:T682,Another symptom is \u003cem\u003edūre vāry-ayanaṁ tīrthaṁ lāvaṇyaṁ keśa-dhāraṇam:\u003c/em\u003e “Just going to some faraway river will be considered a proper pilgrimage, and a man will think he is beautiful if he has long hair.” [\u003ca href=\"/en/library/sb/12/2/6/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e 12.2.6\u003c/a\u003e] Just see how perfectly \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e predicts the future! “In Kali-yuga a man will think he has beco"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"me very beautiful by keeping long hair.” You have very good experience of this in your country. Who could have known that people would be interested in keeping long hair? Yet that is stated in the \u003cem\u003eBhāgavatam: keśa-dhāraṇam. Keśa\u003c/em\u003e means “long hair” and \u003cem\u003edhāraṇam\u003c/em\u003e means “keeping.” Another symptom is \u003cem\u003edūre vāry-ayanaṁ tīrtham:\u003c/em\u003e People will think that a place of pilgrimage must be far away. For example, the Ganges flows through Calcutta, but no one cares to take a bath in the Calcutta Ganges; they’d rather go to Hardwar. It is the same Ganges. The Ganges is coming from Hardwar down to the Bay of Bengal. But people would rather suffer so much hardship to go to Hardwar and take a bath there, because that has become a \u003cem\u003etīrtha,\u003c/em\u003e a place of pilgrimage. Every religion has a \u003cem\u003etīrtha.\u003c/em\u003e The Muslims have Mecca and Medina, and the Christians have Golgotha. Similarly, the Hindus also think they must travel very far to find a \u003cem\u003etīrtha.\u003c/em\u003e But actually, \u003cem\u003etīrthī-kurvanti tīrthāni:\u003c/em\u003e a \u003cem\u003etīrtha\u003c/em\u003e is a place where there are saintly persons. That is a \u003cem\u003etīrtha.\u003c/em\u003e Not that one goes ten thousand miles and simply takes a dip in the water and then comes back.38:T454,“The purpose of life will consist simply of filling one’s stomach, and audacity will become equivalent to conclusive truth. If a man can even maintain his own family members, he will be honored as very expert, and religiosity will be measured by a person’s reputation for material accomplishments.” [\u003ca href=\"/en/library/sb/12/2/6/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e 12.2.6\u003c/a\u003e] So, if somehow one can eat very sumptuously, then he will think all his interests are fulfilled. People will be very hungry, with nothing to eat, and therefore if they can eat very sumptuously on one day, that will be the fulfillment of all their desires. The next symptom is \u003cem\u003esatyatve dhārṣṭyam eva hi:\u003c/em\u003e Anyone who is expert at word jugglery will be considered very truthful. Another symptom, \u003cem\u003edāk"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"ṣyaṁ kuṭumba-bharaṇam:\u003c/em\u003e One shall be considered very expert if he can maintain his family – his wife and children. In other words, this will become very difficult. In fact, it has already become difficult. To maintain a wife and two children is now a great burden. Therefore no one wants to marry.39:T457,\u003cstrong\u003eŚrīla Prabhupāda: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, they are not \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇas.\u003c/em\u003e Those who give education in exchange for money – they are not \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇas\u003c/em\u003e. For instance, we are lecturing, educating people. We don’t say, “Give us a salary.” We simply ask them, “Please come.” That is why we are cooking food and holding so many free festivals. “We’ll give you food. We’ll give you a comfortable seat. Please come and hear about self-realization and God consciousness.” We are not asking money – “First of all pay the fee; then you can come and learn \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e.” We never say that. But these so-called teachers who first of all bargain for a salary – “What salary will you give me?” – that is a dog’s concern. That is not a \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa’s\u003c/em\u003e concern. A \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa\u003c/em\u003e will never ask about a salary. A \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa\u003c/em\u003e is eager to see that people are educated. “Take free education and be educated; be a human being” – this is a \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa’s\u003c/em\u003e concern: You see? I came here not to ask for any money but to give instruction.3c:T450,So Kṛṣṇa explains everything in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e. And our purpose in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to spread the knowledge contained in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e without adding any nonsensical commentary. Then the human society will profit from this knowledge. Now society is not in a sound condition, but if people understand the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā,\u003c/em\u003e and if they actually broaden their outlook, all social, national, and international problems will be solved automatically. There will be no difficulty. But if we don’t find out what the center of existence is, if we man"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"ufacture our own ways to expand our loving feelings, there will be only conflict – not only between individual persons but between the different nations of the world. The nations are trying to be united; in your country there is the United Nations. Unfortunately, instead of the nations becoming united, the flags are increasing. Similarly, India was once one country, Hindustan. Now there is also Pakistan. And some time in the future there will be Sikhistan and then some other “stan.”3d:T43c,Similarly, the whole material creation is due to Kṛṣṇa’s glance (\u003cem\u003esa aikṣata\u003c/em\u003e). In the \u003cem\u003eVedas\u003c/em\u003e it is said that He glanced over matter, thus agitating it. A woman in touch with a man becomes agitated and becomes pregnant and then gives birth to children. The whole creation follows a similar process. Simply by Kṛṣṇa’s glance, matter becomes agitated and then becomes pregnant and gives birth to the living entities. It is simply by His glance that plants, trees, animals, and all other living beings come forth. How is this possible? None of us can say, “Simply by glancing over my wife, I can make her pregnant.” But although this is impossible for us, it is not impossible for Kṛṣṇa. The \u003cem\u003eBrahma-saṁhitā\u003c/em\u003e [5.32] says, \u003cem\u003eaṅgāni yasya sakalendriya-vṛttimanti:\u003c/em\u003e Every part of Kṛṣṇa’s body has all the capabilities of the other parts. With our eyes we can only see, but Kṛṣṇa can make others pregnant merely by looking at them. There is no need of sex, for simply by glancing Kṛṣṇa can create pregnancy.3e:T477,\u003cem\u003ePratyakṣa,\u003c/em\u003e the process of receiving knowledge through direct perception, has no value, because our senses are all imperfect. For example, to us the sun looks like a small disk, but in fact it is many times larger than the earth. So what is the value of our direct perception through our eyes? We have so many senses through which we can experience knowledge – the eyes, the ears, the nose, and so on – but because these senses are imperfect"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,", whatever knowledge we get by exercising these senses is also imperfect. Because scientists try to understand things by exercising their imperfect senses, their conclusions are always imperfect. Svarūpa Dāmodara, a scientist among our disciples, inquired from a fellow scientist who says that life comes from matter, “If I give you the chemicals with which to produce life, will you be able to produce it?” The scientist replied, “That I do not know.” This is imperfect knowledge. If you do not know, then your knowledge is imperfect. Why then have you become a teacher? That is cheating. Our contention is that to become perfect one must take lessons from the perfect teacher.3f:T467,Of course, by nature’s way the tiger, being a nonvegetarian, does not get food every day. After all, who will face a tiger to become its food? Who will say to the tiger, “Sir, I am an altruist and have come to you to give you food, so take my body”? No one. Therefore the tiger has difficulty finding food. And as soon as the tiger is out, there is an animal that follows it and makes a sound like \u003cem\u003e“fayo, fayo,”\u003c/em\u003e so that the other animals will know, “Now the tiger is out.” So by nature’s way the tiger has difficulty. But still Kṛṣṇa supplies it food. After about a week, the tiger will get the chance to catch an animal, and because it does not get fresh food daily, it will keep the carcass in some bush and eat a little at a time. Since the tiger is very powerful, people want to become like a lion or a tiger. But that is not a very good proposition, because if one actually becomes like a tiger one won’t get food daily, but will have to search for food with great labor. If one becomes a vegetarian, however, one will get food every day. The food for a vegetarian is available everywhere.40:T4d5,One should not think that because the holy name of Kṛṣṇa can nullify sinful activities, one may commit a little sinful activity and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa to nullify it. That is the greatest offense (\u003cem\u003enāmno "])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"balād yasya hi pāpa-buddhiḥ\u003c/em\u003e). The members of some religious orders go to church and confess their sins, but then they again commit the same sinful activities. What, then, is the value of their confession? One may confess, “My Lord, out of my ignorance I committed this sin.” But one should not plan, “I shall commit sinful activities and then go to church and confess them, and then the sins will be nullified and I can begin a new chapter of sinful life.” Similarly, one should not knowingly take advantage of the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa \u003cem\u003emantra\u003c/em\u003e to nullify sinful activities so that one may then begin sinful acts again. We should be very careful. Before taking initiation, one promises to have no illicit sex, no intoxicants, no gambling, and no meat-eating, and this vow one should strictly follow. Then one will be clean. If one keeps oneself clean in this way and always engages in devotional service, his life will be a success, and there will be no scarcity of anything he wants.41:T502,For the neophytes, Kṛṣṇa says, \u003cem\u003eraso ’ham apsu kaunteya prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ:\u003c/em\u003e “My dear Kaunteya, I am the taste of water, and I am the light of the sun and the moon.” There is no need to say, “I cannot see God.” Here is God: the taste of water is God. Everyone drinks water, and when one tastes it he is perceiving God. Then why do you say, “I cannot see God”? Think as God directs, and then gradually you’ll see Him. Simply remember this one instruction from \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e – \u003cem\u003eraso ’ham apsu kaunteya prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ:\u003c/em\u003e “I am the taste of water; I am the shining illumination of the sun and moon.” Who has not seen the sunlight? Who has not seen the moonlight? Who has not tasted water? Then why do you say, “I have not seen God”? If you simply practice this \u003cem\u003ebhakti-yoga,\u003c/em\u003e as soon as you taste water and feel satisfied you will think, “Oh, here is Kṛṣṇa.” Immediately you will remember Kṛṣṇa.
