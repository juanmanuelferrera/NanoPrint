So the answer is “Yes, I am seeing God. You can also see God; everyone can see God. But you must have the qualification.” Suppose something is wrong with a motorcar; it is not running. Everyone is seeing it, but a mechanic sees it differently. He’s qualified to see it with greater understanding. So he replaces some missing part, and immediately the car runs.

It is very instructive, so try to hear. One professional reciter was publicly reciting the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em>, and he was describing that Kṛṣṇa is very highly decorated with all kinds of jewels when He goes to tend the cows in the forest. So, there was a thief in that meeting, and he thought, “Why not go to Vṛndāvana and plunder this boy? He’s in the forest with so many valuable jewels. I can go there and catch the child and take all the jewels.” This was his intention. So he was serious. “I must find that boy,” he thought. “Then in one night I shall become a millionaire.”</div></div><div id="bb94167" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The thief’s qualification was his feeling: “I <em>must</em> see Kṛṣṇa! I <em>must</em> see Kṛṣṇa!” That anxiety, that eagerness, made it possible for him to actually see Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvana. He saw Kṛṣṇa in just the same way as the <em>Bhāgavatam</em> reader had described. Then the thief said, “Oh, You are such a nice boy, Kṛṣṇa.” He began to flatter Him; he thought that by flattering Him he would easily take all the jewels. Then he proposed his real business: “May I take some of these ornaments? You are so rich.”</div></div><div id="bb94168" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">“No, no, no,” said Kṛṣṇa. “My mother will be angry!

There is no comparison to the <em>gopīs’</em> devotion, because they loved Kṛṣṇa with heart and soul. That is the qualification. They loved Kṛṣṇa so much that they didn’t care for family or reputation when they went out in the dead of night. Kṛṣṇa’s flute was sounding, and they were all fleeing their homes. Their fathers, their brothers, their husbands all said, “Where are you going? Where are you going in this dead of night?” But the <em>gopīs</em> didn’t care. They neglected their children, their family, everything.

Vedic religion is called <em>sanātana-dharma,</em> “the eternal occupation of the living entity.” The living entity is <em>sanātana</em> [eternal], God is <em>sanātana,</em> and there is <em>sanātana-dharma.

Historically, <em>sanātana-dharma</em> was followed regularly in India, and Indians were called “Hindus” by the Muslims. The Muslims saw that the Indians lived on the other side of the River Sind, and the Muslims pronounced <em>Sind</em> as <em>Hind.</em> Therefore they called India “Hindustan” and the people who lived there “Hindus.” But the word <em>Hindu</em> has no reference in the Vedic literature, nor does so-called Hindu <em>dharma.</em> Now that <em>sanātana-dharma,</em> or Vedic <em>dharma,</em> is being distorted, not being obeyed, not being carried out properly, it has come to be known as Hinduism.

The word <em>veda</em> means “knowledge,” and <em>anta</em> means “end.” So the meaning of <em>vedānta</em> is “the ultimate knowledge,” and the <em>Vedānta-sūtra</em> teaches this. (A <em>sūtra</em> is an aphorism: in a few words, a big philosophy is given.) The first aphorism in the <em>Vedānta-sūtra</em> is <em>athāto brahma-jijñāsā:</em> “Now, in the human form of life, one should inquire about Brahman, the Absolute Truth.” So the study of the <em>Vedānta-sūtra</em> begins when one is inquisitive about the Absolute Truth. And what is that Absolute Truth? That is answered in a nutshell in the second aphorism. <em>Janmādy asya yataḥ:</em> “Brahman is the origin of everything.” So Brahman is God, the origin of everything. And all <em>veda,</em> or knowledge, culminates in Him. This is confirmed by Kṛṣṇa in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> [15.15]: <em>vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyah.</em> “The purpose of all the <em>Vedas,</em> all books of knowledge, is to search out Me.”</div></div><div id="bb94202" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So the whole <em>Vedānta-sūtra</em> is a description of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

That is explained by Lord Kṛṣṇa in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> [7.19]: <em>bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate.</em> “After many, many births, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me.” So unless one surrenders to Kṛṣṇa, there is no <em>jñāna.</em> This impersonalistic <em>“jñāna”</em> is all nonsense. The impersonalists are passing themselves off as <em>jñānīs,</em> but they have no knowledge at all. <em>Vedānta</em> means “the ultimate knowledge.” So the subject matter of ultimate knowledge is Kṛṣṇa, God. If one does not know who God is, who Kṛṣṇa is, then where is one’s knowledge?

It is simply misunderstanding. <em>Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate.</em> One may begin by searching out impersonal Brahman by the speculative method, and then one may progress to realization of Paramātmā, the localized aspect of the Supreme. That is the secondary stage of realization. But the final stage is understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. So if you do not understand Kṛṣṇa, where is your knowledge? Halfway knowledge is no knowledge. We want complete knowledge, and that complete knowledge is possible by the grace of Kṛṣṇa, through <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>.</div></div><div id="bb94213" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Devotee: </strong>Can I ask the next question, Śrīla Prabhupāda? “Is a <em>guru</em> essential for one to enter the spiritual path and attain the goal?

As a fragment of gold is qualitatively the same as a gold reservoir, so the minute particles of Kṛṣṇa’s body are therefore qualitatively as good as Kṛṣṇa. The chemical composition of God’s body and the eternal spiritual body of the living entity is the same – spiritual. Thus originally, in our uncontaminated condition, we possessed a form as good as God’s, but just as rain falls to the ground, so we come in contact with this material world, which is manipulated by the external energy, or material nature.</div></div><div id="bb94229" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">When we speak of external energy or material nature, the questions may be raised, “Whose energy?

When a foolish man sees a machine he may think that it is working automatically, but actually it is not – there is a driver, someone in control, although we sometimes cannot see the controller behind the machine due to our defective vision. There are many electronic mechanisms which work very wonderfully, but behind these intricate systems is a scientist who pushes the button. This is very simple to understand: since a machine is matter, it cannot work on its own accord but must work under spiritual direction. A tape recorder works, but it works according to the plans and under the direction of a living entity, a human being. The machine is complete, but unless it is manipulated by a spirit soul, it cannot work. Similarly, we should understand that this cosmic manifestation which we call nature is a great machine, and that behind this machine there is God, Kṛṣṇa.

Where is the department for this knowledge that we find given by Śrī Kṛṣṇa in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>? When I spoke before some students and faculty members at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the first question I raised was: “Where is the technological department which is investigating the difference between a dead man and a living man?” When a man dies, something is lost. Where is the technology to replace it? Why don’t scientists try to solve this problem? Because this is a very difficult subject matter, they set it aside and busily engage in the technology of eating, sleeping, mating, and defending. However, the Vedic literatures inform us that this is animal technology. Animals are also trying their best to eat well, to have an enjoyable sex life, to sleep peacefully, and to defend themselves. What, then, is the difference between man’s knowledge and the animals’ knowledge? The fact is that man’s knowledge should be developed to explore that difference between a living body and a dead body.</div></div><div id="bb94234" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">That spiritual knowledge was imparted by Kṛṣṇa to Arjuna in the beginning of the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>.

These subjects are called <em> adhokṣaja</em> because our direct perception, by which we acquire material knowledge, fails to approach them. For example, we have many powerful microscopes to see what we cannot see with our limited vision, but there is no microscope that can show us the soul within the body. Nevertheless, the soul is there.</div></div><div id="bb94235" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> informs us that in this body there is a proprietor – the spirit soul. I am the proprietor of my body, and other souls are the proprietors of their bodies. I say “my hand,” but not “I hand.” Since it is “my hand,” I am different from the hand, being its owner. Similarly, we speak of “my eye,” “my leg,” “my” this, “my” that. In the midst of all these objects which belong to me, where am I? The search for the answer to this question is the process of meditation. In real meditation, we ask, “Where am I? What am I?” We cannot find the answers to these questions by any material effort, and because of this all the universities are setting these questions aside. They say, “It is too difficult a subject.” Or they brush it aside: “It is irrelevant.”</div></div><div id="bb94236" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Thus engineers direct their attention to creating and attempting to perfect the horseless carriage and the wingless bird.

Although they invent imitation wings for the airplane, they cannot invent a soulless body. When they are able to do this, they will deserve credit. But such an attempt would necessarily be frustrated, for we know that there is no machine that can work without a spirit soul behind it. Even the most complicated computers need trained men to handle them. Similarly, we should know that this great machine known as the cosmic manifestation is manipulated by a supreme spirit.

He is indeed the perfect person. It may be argued that although we have accepted Him as a perfect person, there are many others who do not. But one should not think that this acceptance is whimsical: He is accepted as the perfect person on the evidence of many authorities. We do not accept Kṛṣṇa as perfect simply on the basis of our whims or sentiments. No – Kṛṣṇa is accepted as God by many Vedic authorities like Vyāsadeva, the author of all Vedic literatures. The treasure house of knowledge is contained in the <em>Vedas,</em> and their author, Vyāsadeva, accepts Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Vyāsadeva’s spiritual master, Nārada, also accepts Kṛṣṇa as such. Nārada’s spiritual master, Brahmā, accepts Kṛṣṇa not only as the Supreme Person but the supreme controller as well – <em>īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ:</em> “The supreme controller is Kṛṣṇa.”</div></div><div id="bb94239" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">There is no one in the creation who can claim that he is not controlled. Everyone, regardless of how important or powerful, has a controller over his head. Kṛṣṇa, however, has no controller; therefore He is God. He is the controller of everyone, but there is no one superior to Him, no one to control Him; nor is there anyone equal to Him, no one to share His platform of absolute control. This may sound very strange, for there are many so-called Gods nowadays. Indeed, Gods have become very cheap, being especially imported from India. People in other countries are fortunate that Gods are not manufactured there, but in India Gods are manufactured practically every day. We often hear that God is coming to Los Angeles or New York and that people are gathering to receive Him, etc. But Kṛṣṇa is not the type of God who is created in a mystic factory. No. He was not <em>made</em> God: He <em>is</em> God.</div></div><div id="bb94240" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">We should know, then, on the basis of authority, that behind this gigantic material nature, the cosmic manifestation, there is God – Kṛṣṇa – and that He is accepted by all Vedic authorities. Acceptance of authority is not new for us; everyone accepts authority – in some form or another. For education we go to a teacher or to a school or simply learn from our father and mother. They are all authorities, and our nature is to learn from them. In our childhood we asked, “Father, what is this?” and Father would say, “This is a pen,” “These are spectacles,” or “This is a table.” In this way, from the very beginning of life a child learns from his father and mother. A good father and mother never cheat when their son inquires from them; they give exact and correct information. Similarly, if we get spiritual information from an authority, and if the authority is not a cheater, then our knowledge is perfect. However, if we attempt to reach conclusions by dint of our own speculative powers, we are subject to fall into error. The process of induction, by which one reasons from particular facts or individual cases and arrives at a general conclusion, is never a perfect process. Because we are limited and our experience is limited, the inductive process of acquiring knowledge will always remain imperfect.</div></div><div id="bb94241" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">But if we receive information from the perfect source, Kṛṣṇa, and if we repeat that information, then what we are speaking can also be accepted as perfect and authoritative. This process of <em>paramparā,</em> or disciplic succession, means hearing from Kṛṣṇa, or from authorities who have accepted Kṛṣṇa, and repeating exactly what they have said. In <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> Kṛṣṇa recommends this process of knowledge: <em>evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ.</em> “This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession, and the saintly kings understood it in that way.” [<a href="/en/library/bg/4/2/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> 4.2</a>]</div></div><div id="bb94242" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Formerly, knowledge was passed down by great saintly kings, who were the authorities. In previous ages, however, these kings were <em>ṛṣis –</em> great learned scholars and devotees – and because they were not ordinary men, the government which they headed worked very nicely. There are many instances in Vedic civilization of kings who attained perfection as devotees of God. For example, Dhruva Mahārāja went to the forest to search out God, and by practice of severe penance and austerity he found God within six months.</div></div><div id="bb94243" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The Kṛṣṇa consciousness process is also based on austerity, but it is not very difficult. There are restrictions governing eating and sex life (only <em>prasādam,</em> food first offered to Kṛṣṇa, is taken, and sex is restricted to married life), and there are other regulations which facilitate and foster spiritual realization. It is not possible in these days to imitate Dhruva Mahārāja, but by following certain basic Vedic principles, we can make advancement in spiritual consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. As we advance, we become perfect in knowledge. What is the use of becoming a scientist or a philosopher if we cannot say what our next life will be? A realized student of Kṛṣṇa consciousness can very easily say what his next life is, what God is, what the living entity is, and what his relationship with God is. His knowledge is perfect because it is coming from perfect books of knowledge, such as the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> and the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em>.</div></div><div id="bb94244" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">This, then, is the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

He can still perfect his life by simply chanting the <em>mahā-mantra:</em> Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. Kṛṣṇa has given us a tongue and two ears, and we may be surprised to know that Kṛṣṇa is realized through the ears and tongue, not through the eyes. By hearing His message, we learn to control the tongue, and after the tongue is controlled, the other senses follow. Of all the senses, the tongue is the most voracious and difficult to control, but it can be controlled simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa and tasting <em>kṛṣṇa-prasādam,</em> food offered to Kṛṣṇa.</div></div><div id="bb94245" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">We cannot understand Kṛṣṇa by sensual perception or by speculation.

We are all under authority, yet we say that we don’t want authority. This is called <em>māyā,</em> illusion. We do, however, have a certain independence – we can choose to be under the authority of our senses or the authority of Kṛṣṇa.

Of course, no one is actually the father or mother of Kṛṣṇa, because Kṛṣṇa is the original father of everyone. But when Kṛṣṇa comes here, when He makes His advent, He accepts certain exalted devotees as His father, as His mother.</div></div><div id="bb94261" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Still, Kṛṣṇa is <em>ādi-puruṣam,</em> the original person.

When Kṛṣṇa was on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra, He was just like a boy of twenty years or, at most, twenty-four years. But at that time He had great-grandchildren. So Kṛṣṇa is always a youth.

In the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> [15.15] Kṛṣṇa says, <em>vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ:</em> “By all the <em>Vedas</em> it is I who am to be known.” What is the use of studying the <em>Vedas</em> if you do not understand Kṛṣṇa? The ultimate goal of education is to understand the Supreme Lord, the supreme father, the supreme cause. As it is said in the <em>Vedānta-sūtra, athāto brahma-jijñāsā:</em> “Now – in the human form of life – is the time to discuss the Supreme Absolute Truth, Brahman.”</div></div><div id="bb94263" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">And what is this Brahman? <em>Janmādy asya yataḥ.</em> Brahman is the one from whom everything emanates.

And this we are getting from the Vedic literature – that Kṛṣṇa is <em>sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam,</em> the cause of all causes.</div></div><div id="bb94264" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Just try to understand. For instance, I am caused by my father; my father is caused by his father; <em>he</em> is caused by <em>his</em> father, who is caused by <em>his</em> father … In this way, if you go on searching, then you’ll ultimately come to someone who is the cause that has no cause. <em>Anādir ādir govindaḥ:</em> The cause that has no cause is Govinda – Kṛṣṇa. I may be the cause of my son, but at the same time I am the result of another cause (my father). But the Vedic literatures say that Kṛṣṇa is the original person; He has no cause.

We should try to understand Kṛṣṇa, why He makes His advent, why He comes down to this material world, what His business is, what His activities are. If we simply try to understand Kṛṣṇa, then what will be the result? The result will be <em>tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti so ’rjuna:</em> we will get immortality.</div></div><div id="bb94266" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The aim of life is <em>amṛtatvāya kalpate,</em> to achieve immortality.

We have the United Nations and many other organizations. They are working to establish real peace and tranquillity, to eliminate misunderstanding between man and man and nation and nation. But that is not happening. The defect is that the root is wrong. Everyone is thinking, “It is my country,” “It is my family,” “It is my society,” “It is my property.” This “my” is illusion. In the Vedic literatures it is said, <em>janasya moho ’yam ahaṁ mameti:</em> This “I-and-my” philosophy is <em>māyā –</em> illusion.</div></div><div id="bb94270" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So if you want to get out of this <em>māyā,</em> this illusion, then you have to accept Kṛṣṇa’s formula. <em>Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te:</em> Whoever surrenders to Kṛṣṇa can easily cross beyond all illusion.

This is our misfortune. In the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> [9.34] Kṛṣṇa says, <em>man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru:</em> “Always think of Me, become My devotee, worship Me, and offer obeisances unto Me.” Is it a very difficult task? Here is Kṛṣṇa’s Deity. If you think of this Deity, is it very difficult? You come into the temple, and just as a devotee would do, you offer your respect to the Deity.

That is the main point. <em>Yo me bhaktyā prayacchati:</em> “Offer something to Me – with devotion.” That is the main principle. Offer Kṛṣṇa some little thing. Kṛṣṇa is not hungry; Kṛṣṇa is providing food for everyone. But Kṛṣṇa wants your love, your devotion. Therefore He is begging a little water or fruit or a flower. In this way, <em>man-manā bhava mad-bhakta:</em> you can think of Kṛṣṇa and become His devotee.</div></div><div id="bb94273" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">There is no difficulty in understanding Kṛṣṇa and accepting Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But we’ll not do it – that is our disease. Otherwise, it is not difficult at all. And as soon as we become a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, we understand the whole universal situation. Our <em>bhāgavata</em> philosophy, our God conscious philosophy, is also a kind of spiritual communism, because we regard Kṛṣṇa as the supreme father and all living entities as sons of Kṛṣṇa. And Kṛṣṇa says, <em>sarva-loka-maheśvaram:</em> He is the proprietor of all planets. Therefore whatever there is, either in the sky or in the water or on the land, it is all Kṛṣṇa’s property. And because we are all sons of Kṛṣṇa, every one of us has the right to use our father’s property. But we should not encroach upon others. This is the formula for peace. <em>Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvaṁ</em> … <em>mā gṛdhaḥ kasyasvid dhanam:</em> “Everything belongs to God, and since you are sons of God, you have the right to use your father’s property. But do not take more than you need.

They have tried so much, but actually nothing they have tried has become fruitful. Take the United Nations. It was organized after the second great war, and they wanted, “We shall now settle everything peacefully.” But there is no such thing. The fighting is going on, between Pakistan and India or between Vietnam and America or this and that. Mundane politics and diplomacy and philosophy – this is not the process. The process is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Everyone has to understand this point, that we are not proprietors. The actual proprietor is Kṛṣṇa. That’s a fact. Take America, for example. Say two hundred years ago, the European immigrants were not the proprietors. Somebody else was the proprietor, and before that somebody else was the proprietor, or it was vacant land. But the actual proprietor is Kṛṣṇa. Artificially we are claiming, “It is my property.” This is called <em>māyā,</em> illusion. So Kṛṣṇa makes His advent to give us this lesson. Kṛṣṇa says, <em>yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata:</em> “My dear Arjuna, I come when there are discrepancies in the process of religious life.” [<a href="/en/library/bg/4/7/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> 4.7</a>]</div></div><div id="bb94277" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">And what is real <em>dharma,</em> real religious life?

Civil law means the word given by the state. You cannot make civil law at home. That is not possible. Whatever the government gives you – “You should act like this” – that is law. Similarly <em>dharma,</em> religious life, means the direction given by God. That is <em>dharma.</em> Simple definition. If you create some <em>dharma</em> or I create some <em>dharma</em> or another man creates another <em>dharma,</em> these are not <em>dharma.</em></div></div><div id="bb94278" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Therefore Kṛṣṇa ends the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> by saying, <em>sarva-dharmān parityajya mam ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja:</em> “Just give up all your concocted ideas about <em>dharma</em> and surrender to Me.” [<a href="/en/library/bg/18/66/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> 18.66</a>] This is <em>dharma –</em> surrender to Kṛṣṇa. Any other <em>“dharma”</em> is not <em>dharma.</em> Otherwise why does Kṛṣṇa ask, <em>sarva-dharmān parityajya –</em> “Give it all up”? He has already said, “In every age I make My advent to establish the principles of religion.” And at last He says that we should give up all the so-called religious principles that we have manufactured. All these man-made principles are not actually religious principles. Real <em>dharma,</em> real religious life, means what is given by God.

We are searching after peace, but we won’t accept the very thing that will actually give us peace. This is our disease. Therefore, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is trying to awaken the dormant Kṛṣṇa consciousness in everyone’s heart. Just consider: four or five years ago, these Europeans and Americans had never even heard of Kṛṣṇa – so how are they now taking Kṛṣṇa consciousness so seriously? Kṛṣṇa consciousness is already there in everyone’s heart. It simply has to be awakened.

There he invited his listeners to contemplate the works of the supreme artist – Lord Kṛṣṇa. “The rose is created out of the energies of the Supreme Lord, but these energies are so subtle and so artistic that a nice flower can bloom overnight. So, Krsna is the greatest artist.”</em></div></div><div id="bb94294" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you very much for coming here and giving us a chance to speak about the supreme artist. The <em>Vedas</em> describe how great an artist Kṛṣṇa is: <em>na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate na tat-samaś cābhyadhikaś ca dṛśyate.</em> Nobody can be found who is greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead or equal to Him, and although He is the greatest artist, He doesn’t have to do anything personally.</div></div><div id="bb94295" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In this world everyone of us knows somebody lesser than us, somebody equal to us, and somebody greater than us. That is our experience. However great you may be, you will find somebody equal to you and somebody greater than you. But as far as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is concerned, great sages have concluded by research and experiment that nobody is equal to Him or greater than Him.</div></div><div id="bb94296" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">God is so great that He has nothing to do, no duties He must perform (<em>na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate</em>). Why? <em>Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate:</em> His energies are multifarious, and they are working automatically, according to His desire (<em>svābhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca</em>). Suppose you are an artist. To paint a picture of a very nice rose, you have to take your brush, mix your colors on the palate, and tax your brain to make the picture beautiful. But in a garden you can see not only one rose but many thousands of roses blooming. They have been very artistically “painted” by nature.</div></div><div id="bb94297" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">But we should go deeper into the matter. What is nature? Nature is a working instrument, that’s all – an energy. Without some energy working, how could the rose bloom so beautifully from the bud? There must be some energy working, and that energy is Kṛṣṇa’s energy. But it acts so subtly and swiftly that we cannot understand how it is working.</div></div><div id="bb94298" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The material energies seem to be working automatically, but actually there is a brain behind them. When you paint a picture, everyone can see that you are working. Similarly, the “painting” of the actual rose is also worked out by several energies. Don’t think that the rose has been created automatically. No. Nothing is created automatically. The rose is created out of the energies of the Supreme Lord, but these energies are so subtle and so artistic that a nice flower can bloom overnight.</div></div><div id="bb94299" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So, Kṛṣṇa is the greatest artist. Nowadays, in the electronic age, a scientist just pushes a button and his machine works so perfectly. Or an airplane pilot simply pushes a button and a huge machine just like a small city flies in the sky. So if it is possible for ordinary men of this world to work so wonderfully simply by pushing some buttons, how much greater must be God’s ability to work. How much more fertile His brain must be than ordinary artists’ or scientists’ brains. Simply by His desire – “Let there be creation!” – everything is immediately manifest. So Kṛṣṇa is the greatest artist.</div></div><div id="bb94300" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">There is no limit to Kṛṣṇa’s artistic ability, because Kṛṣṇa is the seed of all creation (<em>bījaṁ māṁ sarva-bhūtānām</em>). You have all seen a banyan tree. It grows from a small seed. This small seed has so much potency that if you sow it in a fertile place and water it, one day it will become a big banyan tree. Now, what are the potencies, what are the artistic and scientific arrangements, within that small seed that allow it to grow into a big banyan tree? Also, on that banyan tree there are many thousands of fruits, and within each fruit there are thousands of seeds, and each seed contains the potency of another tree. So where is the scientist who can create in that way? Where is the artist within this material world who can create a work of art as pleasing as a banyan tree? These inquiries should be made.</div></div><div id="bb94301" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The first aphorism of the <em>Vedānta-sūtra</em> is <em>athāto brahma-jijñāsā:</em> “In the human form of life one should inquire about the Absolute Truth.” So one should carefully study these questions. You cannot manufacture a machine that automatically grows into a big banyan tree. So don’t you think there must be a big artistic brain, a great scientific brain, behind nature? If you simply say, “Nature is working,” that is not a sufficient explanation.</div></div><div id="bb94302" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The second aphorism of the <em>Vedānta-sūtra</em> is <em>janmādy asya yataḥ:</em> “The Absolute Truth is He from whom everything is generated.” We have to expand our vision from the small things to the great things. Now we become amazed when we see a small sputnik flying in the sky. It is flying toward the moon, and we are giving all credit to the scientists, and the scientists are challenging, “What is God? Science is everything.”</div></div><div id="bb94303" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">But if you are intelligent you will compare the sputnik to the millions and trillions of planets and stars. Just on this tiny earth planet there are so many oceans, so many mountains, so many skyscrapers. But if you go above this planet a few million miles, it will look just like a small spot. You will see it as just a spot in the sky. And there are millions of planets floating in the sky like swabs of cotton. So if we give so much credit to the scientists who have manufactured a sputnik, how much more credit we should give to the person who has manufactured this universal arrangement. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness – appreciating the greatest artist, the greatest scientist.</div></div><div id="bb94304" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">We may appreciate so many artists, but unless we appreciate the greatest artist, Kṛṣṇa, our life is wasted. We find that appreciation in the <em>Brahma-saṁhitā,</em> the prayers of Lord Brahmā, the creator of this universe. In appreciation of Govinda, Kṛṣṇa, he sings,</div></div><div id="bb94305" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic"><em>yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi-<br />koṭiṣv aśeṣa-vasudhādi-vibhūti-bhinnam<br /> tad brahma niṣkalam anantam aśeṣa-bhūtaṁ<br />govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam aham bhajāmi</em></div></div><div id="bb94306" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now we are trying to understand the planetary system by our scientific method. But we have not been able to finish studying even the nearest planet, the moon, what to speak of the millions and billions of other planets. But from the <em>Brahma-saṁhitā</em> we get this knowledge: <em>yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi-koṭiṣu.</em> By the glaring effulgence emanating from Kṛṣṇa’s body, innumerable universes are created. We cannot study even one universe, but from the <em>Brahma-saṁhitā</em> we get information that there are innumerable universes and that in each and every universe there are innumerable planets (<em>jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi-koṭiṣu</em>). (<em>Jagad-aṇḍa</em> means “universes,” and <em>koṭi-koṭiṣu</em> means “in innumerable.”) So there are innumerable universes with innumerable suns, innumerable moons, and innumerable planets.</div></div><div id="bb94307" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">All of this is made possible by Kṛṣṇa’s bodily effulgence, which is called the <em>brahma-jyotir.</em> The <em>jñānīs,</em> those who are trying to approach the Absolute Truth by mental speculation, by dint of their tiny brain power, can at most approach this <em>brahma-jyotir.</em> But that <em>brahma-jyotir</em> is only the illumination of Kṛṣṇa’s body. The best analogy is the sunshine. The sunshine is coming from the sun globe. The sun is localized, and the effulgence of the sun, the sunshine, is distributed all over the universe. Just as the moon reflects the sunshine, the sun also reflects the <em>brahma-jyotir.</em> And the <em>brahma-jyotir</em> is the bodily effulgence of Kṛṣṇa.</div></div><div id="bb94308" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So the greatest art is to understand Kṛṣṇa. That is the greatest art. If we actually want to be an artist, we should try to understand, or try to be intimately associated with, the greatest artist, Kṛṣṇa. For this purpose we have established the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. The members of this society are trained to see in everything the display of Kṛṣṇa’s artistic sense. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness – to see the artistic hand of Kṛṣṇa everywhere.</div></div><div id="bb94309" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> [10.8] Kṛṣṇa says, <em>ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate:</em> “Whatever you see is an emanation from Me. Everything is created out of My energy.” One should understand this fact – that Kṛṣṇa is the origin of everything. Lord Brahmā confirms this in his <em>Brahma-saṁhitā</em> [5.1]: <em>īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ.</em> “Kṛṣṇa is the supreme controller.” Here in this material world we have experience of many controllers. Every one of us is a controller. You are a controller; I am a controller. But above you there is another controller, and above him there is another controller, and so on. You may go on searching out controller after controller, and when you come to the supreme controller – He who is not controlled by anyone but who controls everyone else – that is Kṛṣṇa. This is our definition of God: the supreme controller.</div></div><div id="bb94310" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Nowadays it has become a cheap business to see many “Gods.” But you can test someone to see if he is God. If he is controlled by somebody else, he is not God. Only if he is the supreme controller should you accept him as God. That is the simple test for God.</div></div><div id="bb94311" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now, another quality of God is that He is full of pleasure (<em>ānanda-mayo ’bhyāsāt</em>). By nature the Supreme Absolute Person is <em>ānanda-maya,</em> full of pleasure. Suppose you are an artist. You engage in artistic work just to get some pleasure. By painting a picture you enjoy some <em>rasa,</em> some pleasurable mellow. Otherwise, why would you work so hard? There must be some pleasure in painting.</div></div><div id="bb94312" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So, Kṛṣṇa is <em>raso vai saḥ,</em> the reservoir of all pleasurable mellows. He is <em>sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ,</em> full of eternity, knowledge, and pleasure. (<em>Ānanda</em> means “pleasure.”) His pleasure potency is Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. You have seen pictures of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. So, Rādhārāṇī is the manifestation of Kṛṣṇa’s pleasure potency. As I have already explained, Kṛṣṇa has innumerable energies, and one of these is His pleasure potency, Rādhārāṇī.</div></div><div id="bb94313" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So those who have developed love of God are enjoying transcendental pleasure at every moment by seeing the artistic work of Kṛṣṇa everywhere. That is the position of a devotee. Therefore we request everyone to become a devotee, to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, so that you will see the artistic work of Kṛṣṇa everywhere.</div></div><div id="bb94314" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Seeing Kṛṣṇa everywhere is not difficult. For example, suppose you are thirsty and you drink some water. When you drink you feel so much pleasure. And Kṛṣṇa is the reservoir of all pleasure (<em>raso vai saḥ</em>). So, that pleasure you feel by drinking water – that is Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa states this in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> [7.8]: <em>raso ’ham apsu kaunteya.</em> “I am the taste of water.” For an ordinary person, who cannot fully appreciate Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa is giving the instruction that He is the taste of the water that quenches your thirst. If you simply try to understand that this taste is Kṛṣṇa, or God, you become God conscious.</div></div><div id="bb94315" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So it is not very difficult to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. You simply require a little training. And if you read <em>Bhagavad-gītā As It Is –</em> understanding it the way it is stated by Kṛṣṇa Himself, without any rascaldom or false interpretation – you will become Kṛṣṇa conscious. And if you become Kṛṣṇa conscious, your life is successful. You will return to Kṛṣṇa (<em>tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti</em>).</div></div><div id="bb94316" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">There is no loss in becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious, but the gain is very great. Therefore we request all of you to try to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. Read <em>Bhagavad-gītā As It Is;</em> you will find all the information you need to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. Or, if you don’t want to read <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> please chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.

These laws may be different according to time, circumstances, or people – the state laws of India may not agree cent percent with the laws of the United States – but in every state there are laws that you must obey.

You have love within you – you want to love somebody. A young boy tries to love a young girl; a young girl tries to love a young boy. This is natural, because the loving propensity is within everybody. But we have created circumstances in which our love is being frustrated. Everyone is frustrated – husbands, wives, boys, girls.

If you are given some white powder and you find that it is not sweet, you will at once say, “Oh, this is not sugar; it is something else.” So sweetness is the <em>dharma</em> of sugar.

Your essential characteristic is that you want to love somebody, and therefore you want to serve him. That is your essential characteristic. You love your family, you love your society, you love your community, you love your country. And because you love them, you want to serve them. That tendency to engage in loving service is your essential characteristic, your <em>dharma.</em> Whether you are a Christian, a Mohammedan, or a Hindu, this characteristic will remain. Suppose today you are a Christian. Tomorrow you may become a Hindu, but your serving mood, that loving spirit, will stay with you. Therefore, the tendency to love and serve others is your <em>dharma,</em> or your religion.

Loving God is the natural function of every living entity. It doesn’t matter whether you are a Christian or a Hindu or a Muhammadan. Just try to develop your love of God. Then your religion is very nice. Otherwise it is simply a waste of time (<em>śrama eva hi kevalam</em>). If after executing rituals in a particular type of religion throughout your whole life you have no love for God, then you have simply wasted your time.</div></div><div id="bb94370" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is the postgraduate movement of all kinds of religion.

In other words, three fourths of the total manifestation is beyond the covered, material sky. The material covering is millions and millions of miles thick, and only after penetrating it can one enter the open, spiritual sky. Here Kṛṣṇa uses the words <em>bhāvaḥ anyaḥ,</em> which mean “another nature.” In other words, there is another, spiritual nature besides the material one we ordinarily experience.</div></div><div id="bb94381" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">But even now we are experiencing the spiritual as well as the material nature. How is that? Because we ourselves are a combination of matter and spirit. We are spirit, and only as long as we are within the material body does it move. As soon as we are out of the body, it is as good as stone. So, since we can all personally perceive that there is spirit as well as matter, we should also know that there is a spiritual world as well.</div></div><div id="bb94382" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the seventh chapter of <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> Kṛṣṇa discusses the spiritual and material natures. The spiritual nature is superior, and the material nature is inferior. In this material world the material and spiritual natures are mixed, but if we go beyond this material nature altogether – if we go to the spiritual world – we will find only the superior, spiritual nature. This is the information we get in the eighth chapter.</div></div><div id="bb94383" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">It is not possible to understand these things by experimental knowledge. The scientists can see millions and millions of stars through their telescopes, but they cannot approach them. Their means are insufficient. What to speak of other planets, they cannot approach even the moon planet, which is the nearest. Therefore, we should try to realize how incapable we are of understanding God and God’s kingdom by experimental knowledge. And since getting understanding this way is not possible, it is foolishness to try. Rather, we have to understand God by hearing <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>. There is no other way. No one can understand who his father is by experimental knowledge. One has to simply believe his mother when she says, “Here is your father.” Similarly, one has to believe <em>Bhagavad-gītā;</em> then one can get all the information.</div></div><div id="bb94384" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Nonetheless, while there is no possibility of experimental knowledge about God, if one becomes advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness he will realize God directly. For example, through realization I am firmly convinced of whatever I am saying here about Kṛṣṇa. I am not speaking blindly. Similarly, anyone can realize God. <em>Svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ:</em> Direct knowledge of God will be revealed to anyone who sticks to the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Such a person will actually understand, “Yes, there is a spiritual kingdom, where God resides, and I have to go there. I must prepare to go there.” Before going to another country, one may hear so much about it, but when he actually goes there he understands everything directly. Similarly, if one takes up the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one day he’ll understand God and the kingdom of God directly, and the whole problem of his life will be solved.</div></div><div id="bb94385" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Here Kṛṣṇa uses the word <em>sanātanaḥ</em> to describe that spiritual kingdom. The material nature has a beginning and an end, but the spiritual nature has no beginning and no end. How is that? We can understand by a simple example: Sometimes, when there is a snowfall, we see that the whole sky is covered by a cloud. But actually that cloud is covering only an insignificant part of the whole sky. Because we are very minute, however, when a cloud covers a few hundred miles of the sky, to us the sky looks completely covered. Similarly, this entire material manifestation (called the <em>mahat-tattva</em>) is like a cloud covering an insignificant portion of the spiritual sky. And just as when the cloud clears we can see the bright, sunlit sky, so when we get clear of this covering of matter we can see the original, spiritual sky.</div></div><div id="bb94386" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Furthermore, just as a cloud has a beginning and an end, the material nature also has a beginning and an end, and our material body also has a beginning and an end. Our body simply exists for some time. It takes birth, grows, stays for some time, gives off some by-products, dwindles, and then vanishes. These are the six transformations of the body. Similarly, every material manifestation undergoes these six transformations. Thus at the end this whole material world will be vanquished.</div></div><div id="bb94387" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">But Kṛṣṇa assures us, <em>paras tasmāt tu bhāvo ’nyo ’vyakto ’vyaktāt sanātanaḥ:</em> “Beyond this destructible, cloudlike material nature, there is another, superior nature, which is eternal. It has no beginning and no end.” Then He says, <em>yaḥ sa sarveṣu bhūteṣu naśyatsu na vinaśyati:</em> “When this material manifestation is annihilated, that superior nature will remain.” When a cloud in the sky is annihilated, the sky remains. Similarly, when the cloudlike material manifestation is annihilated, the spiritual sky remains. This is called <em>avyakto ’vyaktāt.</em></div></div><div id="bb94388" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">There are many volumes of Vedic literature containing information about the material sky and the spiritual sky. In the Second Canto of <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> we find a description of the spiritual sky: what its nature is, what kind of people live there, what their features are – everything. We even get information that in the spiritual sky there are spiritual airplanes. The living entities there are all liberated, and when they fly in their airplanes they look as beautiful as lightning.</div></div><div id="bb94389" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So, everything in the spiritual world is substantial and original.

Every sane man knows that it is an imitation. But the so-called beautiful things in this material world are just like the beautiful “girl” in the shopkeeper’s window. Indeed, whatever beautiful thing we see here in this material world is simply an imitation of the real beauty in the spiritual world. As Śrīdhara Svāmī says, <em>yat satyatayā mithyā sargo ’pi satyavat pratīyate:</em> “The spiritual world is real, and the unreal, material manifestation only appears real.” Something is real only if it will exist eternally. Reality cannot be vanquished. Similarly, real pleasure must be eternal. Since material pleasure is temporary, it is not actual, and those who seek real pleasure don’t take part in this shadow pleasure. They strive for the real, eternal pleasure of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div></div><div id="bb94391" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Here Kṛṣṇa says, <em>yaḥ sa sarveṣu bhūteṣu naśyatsu na vinaśyati:</em> “When everything in the material world is annihilated, that spiritual nature will remain eternally.” The aim of human life is to reach that spiritual sky. But people do not know the reality of the spiritual sky. The <em>Bhāgavatam</em> says, <em>na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum:</em> “People do not know their self-interest. They do not know that human life is meant for understanding spiritual reality and preparing ourselves for being transferred to that reality. It is not meant for remaining here in the material world.” The whole of Vedic literature instructs us like this. <em>Tamasi mā jyotir gamaḥ:</em> “Don’t remain in the darkness; go to the light.” This material world is darkness. We are artificially illuminating it with electric lights and fires and so many other things, but its nature is dark. The spiritual world, however, is not dark; it is full of light. Just as on the sun planet there is no possibility of darkness, so there is no possibility of darkness in the spiritual nature, because every planet there is self-illuminated.</div></div><div id="bb94392" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">It is clearly stated in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> that the supreme destination, from which there is no return, is the abode of Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Person. The <em>Brahma-saṁhitā</em> describes this supreme abode as <em>ānanda-cinmaya-rasa,</em> a place where everything is full of spiritual bliss. Whatever variegatedness is manifest there is all of the quality of spiritual bliss – nothing there is material. That spiritual variegatedness is the spiritual expansion of the Supreme Godhead Himself, for the manifestation there is totally of the spiritual energy.</div></div><div id="bb94393" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Although the Lord is always in His supreme abode, He is nonetheless all-pervading by His material energy. So by His spiritual and material energies, He is present everywhere – in both the material and the spiritual universes. In <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>, the words <em>yasyāntaḥ-sthāni bhūtāni</em> indicate that everything is sustained by Him, whether it be spiritual or material energy.</div></div><div id="bb94394" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">It is clearly stated in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> that only by <em>bhakti,</em> or devotional service, can one enter into the Vaikuṇṭha (spiritual) planetary system. In all the Vaikuṇṭhas there is only one Supreme Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, who has expanded Himself into millions and millions of plenary portions. These plenary expansions are four-armed, and They preside over innumerable spiritual planets. They are known by a variety of names: Puruṣottama, Trivikrama, Keśava, Mādhava, Aniruddha, Hṛṣīkeśa, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna, Śrīdhara, Vāsudeva, Dāmodara, Janārdana, Nārāyaṇa, Vāmana, Padmanābha, and so on. These plenary expansions are like the leaves of a tree, the main trunk of the tree being like Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa, dwelling in Goloka Vṛndāvana, His supreme abode, systematically and flawlessly conducts all affairs of both universes (material and spiritual) by the power of His all-pervasiveness.</div></div><div id="bb94395" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now, if we are at all interested in reaching Kṛṣṇa’s supreme abode, then we must practice <em>bhakti-yoga.</em> The word <em>bhakti</em> means “devotional service,” or, in other words, submission to the Supreme Lord. Kṛṣṇa clearly says, <em>puruṣaḥ sa paraḥ pārtha bhaktyā labhyas tv ananyayā.</em> The words <em>tv ananyayā</em> here mean “without any other engagement.” So, to reach the spiritual abode of the Lord, we must engage in pure devotional service to Kṛṣṇa.</div></div><div id="bb94396" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">One definition of <em>bhakti</em> is given in the authoritative book <em>Nārada-pañcarātra:</em></div></div><div id="bb94397" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic"><em>sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ<br />tat-paratvena nirmalam<br /> hṛṣīkena hṛṣīkeśa-<br />sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate</em></div></div><div id="bb94398" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">“<em>Bhakti,</em> or devotional service, means engaging all our senses in the service of the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the master of all the senses.

Our bodies are not we ourselves, yet we identify with these designations. Suppose one has received a university degree and identifies himself as an M.A. or a B.A. or a Ph.D. <em>He</em> is not that degree, but he has identified with that designation. So, <em>bhakti</em> means to free oneself from these designations (<em>sarvopādhi-vinirmuktam</em>). <em>Upādhi</em> means “designation.” If someone gets the title “Sir,” he becomes very happy: “Oh, I have this `Sir’ title.” He forgets that this title is only his designation – that it will exist only as long as he has his body. But the body is sure to be vanquished, along with all its designations. When one gets another body, he gets other designations. Suppose in the present lifetime one is an American. The next body he gets may be Chinese. Therefore, since we are always changing our bodily designations, we should stop identifying them as our self. When one is determined to free himself of all these nonsensical designations, then he can attain <em>bhakti.</em></div></div><div id="bb94400" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the above verse from the <em>Nārada-pañcarātra,</em> the word <em>nirmalam</em> means “completely pure.” What is that purity?

I am an eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa; that is my real identity.” One who is freed from false designations and fixed in his real constitutional position always renders service to Kṛṣṇa with his senses (<em>hṛṣīkena hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate</em>). The word <em>hṛṣīka</em> means “the senses.” Now our senses are designated, but when our senses are free from designations, and when with that freedom and in that purity we serve Kṛṣṇa – that is devotional service.</div></div><div id="bb94401" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī explains pure devotional service in this verse from <em>Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu</em> [1.1.11]:</div></div><div id="bb94402" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic"><em>anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ<br />jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam<br /> ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-<br />śīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā</em></div></div><div id="bb94403" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">“When first-class devotional service develops, one must be devoid of all material desires, of knowledge tainted by monistic philosophy, and of fruitive action.

Also, we should be free from material desires (<em>anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam</em>). Usually one wants to serve God for some material purpose. Of course, that is also good. If someone goes to God for some material gain, he’s far greater than the person who never goes to God.

Of course, we <em>should</em> try to understand Kṛṣṇa, but we should always remember that He is unlimited and that we can never fully understand Him. It is not possible for us to do this. Therefore, we have to accept whatever is presented to us in the revealed scriptures. The <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> for example, is presented by Kṛṣṇa for our understanding. We should try to understand Him simply by hearing from books like <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> and <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em>. The word <em>karma</em> means “work with some fruitive result.” If we want to practice pure <em>bhakti,</em> we should work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness selflessly – not just to get some profit out of it.</div></div><div id="bb94407" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Next Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī says that pure <em>bhakti</em> must be <em>ānukūlyena,</em> or favorable.

By hearing <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> and taking the right interpretation from the right person. Then we’ll know what Kṛṣṇa wants, and we can act accordingly.

In <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> Kṛṣṇa says, <em>puruṣaḥ sa paraḥ pārtha bhaktyā labhyas tv ananyayā:</em> One can approach the Supreme Person only by devotional service – not by challenge, not by philosophical speculation, and not by exercising in this <em>yoga</em> or that <em>yoga.</em> No. It is clearly stated that one can approach Kṛṣṇa only by surrender and devotional service. It is not stated that one can reach Him by philosophical speculation or mental concoction or some physical exercise. One can reach Kṛṣṇa only by practicing devotion, without deviating to fruitive activities, philosophical speculation, or physical exercise.

How can this be? The sun is located in one place, but the sun rays are distributed all over the universe. Similarly, although God is situated in His own abode in the spiritual sky, His energy is distributed everywhere. Also, He’s not different from His energy, just as the sun and the sunshine are not different, in the sense that they are composed of the same illuminating substance. So, Kṛṣṇa distributes Himself everywhere by His energies, and when we become advanced in devotional service we can see Him everywhere, just as one can light a lamp anywhere by plugging it into the electric circuit.</div></div><div id="bb94412" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In his <em>Brahma-saṁhitā,</em> Lord Brahmā describes the qualifications we require to see God: <em>premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti.</em> Those who have developed love of God can constantly see God before them, twenty-four hours a day. The word <em>sadaiva</em> means “constantly, twenty-four hours a day.” If one is actually God-realized, he doesn’t say, “Oh, I saw God yesterday night, but now He’s not visible.” No, He’s <em>always</em> visible, because He’s everywhere.</div></div><div id="bb94413" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Therefore, the conclusion is that we can see Kṛṣṇa everywhere, but we have to develop the eyes to see Him.

Historically, \u003cem\u003esanātana-dharma\u003c/em\u003e was followed regularly in India, and Indians were called “Hindus” by the Muslims. The Muslims saw that the Indians lived on the other side of the River Sind, and the Muslims pronounced \u003cem\u003eSind\u003c/em\u003e as \u003cem\u003eHind.\u003c/em\u003e Therefore they called India “Hindustan” and the people who lived there “Hindus.” But the word \u003cem\u003eHindu\u003c/em\u003e has no reference in the Vedic literature, nor does so-called Hindu \u003cem\u003edharma.\u003c/em\u003e Now that \u003cem\u003esanātana-dharma,\u003c/em\u003e or Vedic \u003cem\u003edharma,\u003c/em\u003e is being distorted, not being obeyed, not being carried out properly, it has come to be known as Hinduism. But that is a freak understanding; that is not a real understanding. We have to study \u003cem\u003esanātana-dharma\u003c/em\u003e as it is described in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e and other Vedic literatures; then we’ll understand what Vedic religion is.

Even today, if any Hindu says, “I don’t care for Kṛṣṇa and \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e,” he will immediately be rejected as a madman. Why don’t you take Kṛṣṇa’s instruction? Why go elsewhere? Your trouble is that you do not know what religion is, and you do not know what \u003cem\u003esanātana-dharma\u003c/em\u003e is. In our Kṛṣṇa consciousness society there are many who were formerly so-called Hindus, so-called Muslims, and so-called Christians, but now they don’t care for “Hindu” or “Muslim” or “Christian.” They care only for Kṛṣṇa.

But people want to be cheated, and the cheaters are taking advantage of them. The word \u003cem\u003eveda\u003c/em\u003e means “knowledge,” and \u003cem\u003eanta\u003c/em\u003e means “end.” So the meaning of \u003cem\u003evedānta\u003c/em\u003e is “the ultimate knowledge,” and the \u003cem\u003eVedānta-sūtra\u003c/em\u003e teaches this. (A \u003cem\u003esūtra\u003c/em\u003e is an aphorism: in a few words, a big philosophy is given.) The first aphorism in the \u003cem\u003eVedānta-sūtra\u003c/em\u003e is \u003cem\u003eathāto brahma-jijñāsā:\u003c/em\u003e “Now, in the human form of life, one should inquire about Brahman, the Absolute Truth.” So the study of the \u003cem\u003eVedānta-sūtra\u003c/em\u003e begins when one is inquisitive about the Absolute Truth. And what is that Absolute Truth?

In the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e it is clearly stated that material nature does not work independently. When a foolish man sees a machine he may think that it is working automatically, but actually it is not – there is a driver, someone in control, although we sometimes cannot see the controller behind the machine due to our defective vision. There are many electronic mechanisms which work very wonderfully, but behind these intricate systems is a scientist who pushes the button. This is very simple to understand: since a machine is matter, it cannot work on its own accord but must work under spiritual direction. A tape recorder works, but it works according to the plans and under the direction of a living entity, a human being. The machine is complete, but unless it is manipulated by a spirit soul, it cannot work. Similarly, we should understand that this cosmic manifestation which we call nature is a great machine, and that behind this machine there is God, Kṛṣṇa. This is also affirmed in \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e, where Kṛṣṇa says,32:T4a0,There are many universities, especially in the United States, and many departments of knowledge, but they are not discussing these points.

Because this is a very difficult subject matter, they set it aside and busily engage in the technology of eating, sleeping, mating, and defending. However, the Vedic literatures inform us that this is animal technology. Animals are also trying their best to eat well, to have an enjoyable sex life, to sleep peacefully, and to defend themselves. What, then, is the difference between man’s knowledge and the animals’ knowledge? The fact is that man’s knowledge should be developed to explore that difference between a living body and a dead body.33:T498,Our process of knowledge is very easy. Kṛṣṇa’s instruction, \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā,\u003c/em\u003e is the principal book of knowledge given by the \u003cem\u003eādi-puruṣa\u003c/em\u003e Himself, the Supreme Primeval Person, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is indeed the perfect person. It may be argued that although we have accepted Him as a perfect person, there are many others who do not. But one should not think that this acceptance is whimsical: He is accepted as the perfect person on the evidence of many authorities. We do not accept Kṛṣṇa as perfect simply on the basis of our whims or sentiments. No – Kṛṣṇa is accepted as God by many Vedic authorities like Vyāsadeva, the author of all Vedic literatures.

Acceptance of authority is not new for us; everyone accepts authority – in some form or another. For education we go to a teacher or to a school or simply learn from our father and mother. They are all authorities, and our nature is to learn from them. In our childhood we asked, “Father, what is this?” and Father would say, “This is a pen,” “These are spectacles,” or “This is a table.” In this way, from the very beginning of life a child learns from his father and mother. A good father and mother never cheat when their son inquires from them; they give exact and correct information. Similarly, if we get spiritual information from an authority, and if the authority is not a cheater, then our knowledge is perfect. However, if we attempt to reach conclusions by dint of our own speculative powers, we are subject to fall into error. The process of induction, by which one reasons from particular facts or individual cases and arrives at a general conclusion, is never a perfect process. Because we are limited and our experience is limited, the inductive process of acquiring knowledge will always remain imperfect.35:T5cf,There is no difficulty in understanding Kṛṣṇa and accepting Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But we’ll not do it – that is our disease. Otherwise, it is not difficult at all. And as soon as we become a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, we understand the whole universal situation. Our \u003cem\u003ebhāgavata\u003c/em\u003e philosophy, our God conscious philosophy, is also a kind of spiritual communism, because we regard Kṛṣṇa as the supreme father and all living entities as sons of Kṛṣṇa. And Kṛṣṇa says, \u003cem\u003esarva-loka-maheśvaram:\u003c/em\u003e He is the proprietor of all planets.

We should act for Kṛṣṇa; we should do everything for Kṛṣṇa.36:T519,Nor can we get any relief through our politicians, diplomats, philosophers. They have tried so much, but actually nothing they have tried has become fruitful. Take the United Nations. It was organized after the second great war, and they wanted, “We shall now settle everything peacefully.” But there is no such thing. The fighting is going on, between Pakistan and India or between Vietnam and America or this and that. Mundane politics and diplomacy and philosophy – this is not the process. The process is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Everyone has to understand this point, that we are not proprietors. The actual proprietor is Kṛṣṇa. That’s a fact. Take America, for example. Say two hundred years ago, the European immigrants were not the proprietors. Somebody else was the proprietor, and before that somebody else was the proprietor, or it was vacant land. But the actual proprietor is Kṛṣṇa. Artificially we are claiming, “It is my property.” This is called \u003cem\u003emāyā,\u003c/em\u003e illusion. So Kṛṣṇa makes His advent to give us this lesson. Kṛṣṇa says, \u003cem\u003eyadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata:\u003c/em\u003e “My dear Arjuna, I come when there are discrepancies in the process of religious life.” [\u003ca href=\"/en/library/bg/4/7/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eBhaga"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"vad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e 4.7\u003c/a\u003e]37:T48f,Here Kṛṣṇa says, \u003cem\u003eyaḥ sa sarveṣu bhūteṣu naśyatsu na vinaśyati:\u003c/em\u003e “When everything in the material world is annihilated, that spiritual nature will remain eternally.” The aim of human life is to reach that spiritual sky. But people do not know the reality of the spiritual sky.

They do not know that human life is meant for understanding spiritual reality and preparing ourselves for being transferred to that reality. It is not meant for remaining here in the material world.” The whole of Vedic literature instructs us like this. \u003cem\u003eTamasi mā jyotir gamaḥ:\u003c/em\u003e “Don’t remain in the darkness; go to the light.” This material world is darkness. We are artificially illuminating it with electric lights and fires and so many other things, but its nature is dark. The spiritual world, however, is not dark; it is full of light. Just as on the sun planet there is no possibility of darkness, so there is no possibility of darkness in the spiritual nature, because every planet there is self-illuminated.38:T4a9,Now we are encumbered by so many bodily designations. “Indian,” “American,” “African,” “European” – these are all bodily designations. Our bodies are not we ourselves, yet we identify with these designations.

That is the first thing to be understood. Vedic religion is called \u003cem\u003esanātana-dharma,\u003c/em\u003e “the eternal occupation of the living entity.” The living entity is \u003cem\u003esanātana\u003c/em\u003e [eternal], God is \u003cem\u003esanātana,\u003c/em\u003e and there is \u003cem\u003esanātana-dharma. Sanātana-dharma\u003c/em\u003e is meant for all living entities, not just the so-called Hindus. Hinduism, this “ism,” that “ism” – these are all misconception. Historically, \u003cem\u003esanātana-dharma\u003c/em\u003e was followed regularly in India, and Indians were called “Hindus” by the Muslims. The Muslims saw that the Indians lived on the other side of the River Sind, and the Muslims pronounced \u003cem\u003eSind\u003c/em\u003e as \u003cem\u003eHind.\u003c/em\u003e Therefore they called India “Hindustan” and the people who lived there “Hindus.” But the word \u003cem\u003eHindu\u003c/em\u003e has no reference in the Vedic literature, nor does so-called Hindu \u003cem\u003edharma.\u003c/em\u003e Now that \u003cem\u003esanātana-dharma,\u003c/em\u003e or Vedic \u003cem\u003edharma,\u003c/em\u003e is being distorted, not being obeyed, not being carried out properly, it has come to be known as Hinduism. But that is a freak understanding; that is not a real understanding. We have to study \u003cem\u003esanātana-dharma\u003c/em\u003e as it is described in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e and other Vedic literatures; then we’ll understand what Vedic religion is.

Why go elsewhere? Your trouble is that you do not know what religion is, and you do not know what \u003cem\u003esanātana-dharma\u003c/em\u003e is. In our Kṛṣṇa consciousness society there are many who were formerly so-called Hindus, so-called Muslims, and so-called Christians, but now they don’t care for “Hindu” or “Muslim” or “Christian.” They care only for Kṛṣṇa.
