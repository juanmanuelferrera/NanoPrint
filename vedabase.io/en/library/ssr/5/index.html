The yoga system, as is stated in the standard yoga practice formula given by Lord Kṛṣṇa in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> and as recommended in the Patañjali yoga discipline, is different from the nowadays-practiced <em>haṭha-yoga</em> as is generally understood in the Western countries.</div></div><div id="bb97420" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Real yoga practice means to control the senses and, after such control is established, to concentrate the mind on the Nārāyaṇa form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Lord Kṛṣṇa is the original Absolute Personality, the Godhead, and all the other Viṣṇu forms – with four hands, decorated with conch, lotus, club, and wheel – are plenary expansions of Kṛṣṇa.</div></div><div id="bb97421" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> it is recommended that we should meditate upon the form of the Lord. For practicing concentration of the mind, one has to sit down in a secluded place sanctified by a sacred atmosphere, and the yogi should observe the rules and regulations of <em>brahmacarya –</em> to live a life of strict self-restraint and celibacy. No one can practice yoga in a congested city, living a life of extravagance, including unrestricted sex indulgence and adultery of the tongue.</div></div><div id="bb97422" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">We have already stated that yoga practice means controlling the senses, and the beginning of controlling the senses is to control the tongue. You cannot allow the tongue to take all kinds of forbidden food and drink, and at the same time improve in the practice of yoga. It is a very regrettable fact that many stray, unauthorized so-called yogis now come to the West and exploit the leaning of the people toward yoga. Such unauthorized yogis even dare to say publicly that one can indulge in drinking and at the same time practice meditation.</div></div><div id="bb97423" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Five thousand years ago, in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> dialogue, Lord Kṛṣṇa recommended yoga practice to His disciple Arjuna, but Arjuna flatly expressed his inability to follow the stringent rules and regulations of yoga. One should be practical in every field of activity. One should not waste his valuable time simply in practicing some gymnastic feats in the name of yoga. Real yoga is to search out the four-handed Supersoul within one’s heart and to see Him perpetually in meditation. Such continued meditation is called <em>samādhi.</em> If, however, one wants to meditate upon something void or impersonal, it will require a very long time to achieve anything by yoga practice. We cannot concentrate our mind on something void or impersonal. Real yoga practice is to fix the mind on the person of the four-handed Nārāyaṇa who dwells in everyone’s heart.</div></div><div id="bb97424" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Sometimes it is said that by meditation one will understand that God is seated within one’s heart always, even when one does not know it. God is seated within the heart of everyone. Not only is He seated in the heart of the human being, but He is also within the hearts of the cats and dogs. The <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> certifies this with the declaration that Īśvara, the supreme controller of the world, is seated in the heart of everyone. He is present not only in everyone’s heart, but also within the atoms. No place is vacant; no place is without the presence of the Lord.</div></div><div id="bb97425" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The feature of the Lord by which He is present everywhere is called the Paramātmā. <em>Ātmā</em> means the individual soul, and Paramātmā means the individual Supersoul. Both <em>ātmā</em> and Paramātmā are individual persons. The difference between them, however, is that the <em>ātmā,</em> or soul, is present only in one particular place, whereas the Paramātmā is present everywhere.</div></div><div id="bb97426" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In this connection, the example of the sun is very nice. An individual person may be situated in one place, but the sun, even though a specific individual entity, is present over the head of every individual person. In the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> this is very nicely explained. Therefore, even though the qualities of all entities, including the Lord, are equal, the Supersoul is different from the individual soul by quantity of expansion. The Lord, or Supersoul, can expand Himself into millions of different forms, while the individual soul cannot do so.</div></div><div id="bb97427" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The Supersoul, being seated in everyone’s heart, can witness everyone’s activities, past, present, and future. In the <em>Upaniṣads</em> the Supersoul is said to be sitting with the individual soul as a friend and witness. As a friend He is always anxious to get the individual soul back home, back to Godhead. As a witness, He is the endower of all benedictions that result from the individual’s actions. The Supersoul gives the individual soul all facility for achieving whatever he may desire. But He instructs His friend, so that he may ultimately give up all other engagements and simply surrender unto God for perpetual bliss and eternal life, full of knowledge. This is the last instruction of the <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> the most authorized and widely read book on all forms of yoga.</div></div><div id="bb97428" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The last word of the <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> as stated above, is the last word in the matter of perfecting the yoga system.

What is this Kṛṣṇa consciousness?</div></div><div id="bb97429" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Just as the individual soul is present by his consciousness throughout the whole body, so the Supersoul, or Paramātmā, is present throughout the whole creation by His superconsciousness. This superconsciousness cannot be imitated by the individual soul, who has limited awareness: I can understand what is going on within my limited body, but I cannot feel what is going on in another’s body. I am present all over my body by my consciousness, but I am not present in any other’s body by my consciousness. However, the Supersoul, or Paramātmā, being present within everyone, situated everywhere, is conscious of every existence. The theory that the soul and the Supersoul are one is not acceptable, because the individual soul’s consciousness cannot act in superconsciousness. This superconsciousness can only be achieved by dovetailing individual consciousness with the superconsciousness; and this dovetailing process is called surrender, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div></div><div id="bb97430" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">From the teachings of the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> we learn very clearly that Arjuna in the beginning did not want to fight with his relatives, but after understanding the <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> when he dovetailed his consciousness with the superconsciousness of Kṛṣṇa, his consciousness was Kṛṣṇa consciousness. A person in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness acts by the dictation of Kṛṣṇa, and so Arjuna agreed to fight the Battle of Kurukṣetra.</div></div><div id="bb97431" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the beginning of Kṛṣṇa consciousness this dictation of the Lord is received through the transparent medium of the spiritual master. When one is sufficiently trained and acts with submissive faith and love for Kṛṣṇa, under the direction of the bona fide spiritual master, the dovetailing process becomes more firm and accurate. At this stage Kṛṣṇa dictates from within. From without, the devotee is helped by the spiritual master, the bona fide representative of Kṛṣṇa, and from within the Lord helps the devotee as <em>caitya-guru,</em> being seated within the heart of everyone.</div></div><div id="bb97432" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Simply to understand that God is seated in everyone’s heart is not perfection.

It is the custom in India that when a child is born, an astrologer is called for. When Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appeared five thousand years ago, Garga Muni was called by His father, and he said, “This child formerly incarnated in three complexions, such as red and golden, and now He has appeared in blackish color.” Kṛṣṇa’s color is described in the scriptures as blackish, just like the color of a cloud. Lord Caitanya is understood to be Kṛṣṇa appearing in golden complexion.</div></div><div id="bb97454" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">There is much evidence in Vedic literature that Caitanya Mahāprabhu is an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa, and this is confirmed by scholars and devotees. In the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> it is confirmed that the incarnation of Kṛṣṇa, or God, in this present age, Kali-yuga, will always engage in describing Kṛṣṇa. He is Kṛṣṇa, but as a devotee of Kṛṣṇa He describes Himself. And in this age His bodily complexion will not be blackish. This means that it may be white, it may be red, or it may be yellow, because these four colors – white, red, yellow, and black – are the colors assumed by the incarnations for the different ages. Therefore, since the red, white, and blackish colors were already taken by former incarnations, the remaining color, golden, is assumed by Caitanya Mahāprabhu. His complexion is not blackish, but He is Kṛṣṇa.</div></div><div id="bb97455" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Another feature of this <em>avatāra</em> is that He is always accompanied by His associates. In the picture of Caitanya Mahāprabhu one will find that He is always followed by many devotees chanting. Whenever God incarnates He has two missions, as stated in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> There Kṛṣṇa says, “Whenever I appear, My mission is to deliver the pious devotees and to annihilate the demons.” When Kṛṣṇa appeared, He had to kill many demons. If we see a picture of Viṣṇu we will notice that He has a conchshell, lotus flower, club, and disc. These last two items are meant for killing demons. Within this world there are two classes of men – the demons and the devotees. The devotees are called demigods; they are almost like God because they have godly qualities. Those who are devotees are called godly persons, and those who are nondevotees, atheists, are called demons. So Kṛṣṇa, or God, comes with two missions: to give protection to the devotees and to destroy the demons.</div></div><div id="bb97456" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In this age Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s mission is also like that: to deliver the devotees and to annihilate the nondevotees, the demons. But in this age He has a different weapon. That weapon is not a club or disc or lethal weapon – His weapon is the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement. He killed the demoniac mentality of the people by introducing the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement. That is the specific significance of Lord Caitanya. In this age people are already killing themselves. They have discovered atomic weapons with which to kill themselves, so there is no need for God to kill them. But He appeared to kill their demoniac mentality. That is possible by this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.</div></div><div id="bb97457" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Therefore, in the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> it is said that this is the incarnation of God in this age. And who worships Him? The process is very simple. Just keep a picture of Lord Caitanya with His associates. Lord Caitanya is in the middle, accompanied by His principal associates – Nityānanda, Advaita, Gadādhara, and Śrīvāsa. One simply has to keep this picture. One can keep it anywhere. It is not that one has to come to us to see this picture. Anyone can have this picture in his home, chant this Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, and thus worship Lord Caitanya. That is the simple method. But who will capture this simple method? Those who have good brains. Without much bother, if one simply keeps a picture of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu at home and chants Hare Kṛṣṇa, then one will realize God. Anyone can adopt this simple method. There is no expenditure, there is no tax, nor is there any need to build a very big church or temple. Anyone, anywhere, can sit down on the road or beneath a tree and chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra and worship God. Therefore it is a great opportunity. For example, in business or political life one sometimes finds a great opportunity. Those who are intelligent politicians take a good opportunity and make a success of it the first time it comes. Similarly, in this age, those who have sufficient intelligence take to this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement, and they advance very quickly.</div></div><div id="bb97458" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Lord Caitanya is called “the golden <em>avatāra.</em>” <em>Avatāra</em> means “descending, coming down.” Just as one may come down from the fifth story or the one-hundredth story of a building, an <em>avatāra</em> comes down from the spiritual planets in the spiritual sky. The sky we see with our naked eyes or with a telescope is only the material sky. But beyond this there is another sky, which is not possible to see with our eyes or instruments. That information is in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā;</em> it is not imagination. Kṛṣṇa says that beyond the material sky is another sky, the spiritual sky.</div></div><div id="bb97459" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">We have to take Kṛṣṇa’s word as it is. For example, we teach small children that beyond England there are other places, called Germany, India, etc., and the child has to learn about these places from the version of the teacher because they are beyond his sphere. Similarly, beyond this material sky there is another sky. One cannot experiment to find it, any more than a small child can experiment to find Germany or India. That is not possible. If we want to get knowledge, then we have to accept authority. Similarly, if we want to know what is beyond the material world, then we have to accept the Vedic authority. Otherwise there is no possibility of knowing. It is beyond material knowledge. One cannot go to the far planets in this universe, what to speak of going beyond this universe. The estimation is that in order to go to the highest planet of this universe with modern machinery one would have to travel for forty thousand years. So we cannot even travel within this material sky. Our lifetime and means are so limited that we cannot have proper knowledge of even this material world.</div></div><div id="bb97460" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> when Arjuna asked Kṛṣṇa, “Will You kindly explain the extent to which Your energies are working?” the Supreme Lord gave him so many instances, and at the end He finally said, “My dear Arjuna, what shall I explain about My energies? It is not actually possible for you to understand. But you can just imagine the expansion of My energies: this material world, which consists of millions of universes, is a display of only one fourth of My creation.” We cannot estimate the position of even one universe, and there are millions of universes. Then beyond that is the spiritual sky, and there are millions of spiritual planets. All this information is available from the Vedic literature. If one accepts Vedic literature, then he can get this knowledge. If one doesn’t accept it, there is no other means. That is our choice. Therefore, according to Vedic civilization, whenever an <em>ācārya</em> speaks he immediately gives references from the Vedic literature. Then others will accept it: “Yes, it is correct.” In a law court the lawyer gives references from past judgments of the court, and if his case is tight, the judge accepts. Similarly, if one can give evidence from the <em>Vedas,</em> then it is understood that his position is factual.</div></div><div id="bb97461" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The <em>avatāra</em> for this age, Lord Caitanya, is described in Vedic literature. We cannot accept anyone as an <em>avatāra</em> unless he has the symptoms described in the scriptures. We do not whimsically accept Lord Caitanya as an <em>avatāra</em> on the basis of votes. Nowadays it has become a fashion that any man can come and say that he is God or an incarnation of God, and some fools and rascals will accept it: “Oh, he is God.” We do not accept an <em>avatāra</em> like that. We take evidence from the <em>Vedas.</em> An <em>avatāra</em> must conform to descriptions in the <em>Vedas.</em> Then we accept him; otherwise no. For each <em>avatāra</em> there is a description in the <em>Vedas:</em> He will appear at such and such a place, in such and such a form, and He will act like this. That is the nature of Vedic evidence.</div></div><div id="bb97462" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> there is a list of the <em>avatāras,</em> and there is mention of Lord Buddha’s name. This <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> was written five thousand years ago, and it mentions different names for future times. It says that in the future the Lord would appear as Lord Buddha, his mother’s name would be Añjanā, and he would appear in Gayā. So Buddha appeared twenty-six hundred years ago, and the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</em> which was written five thousand years ago, mentioned that in the future he would appear. Similarly, there is mention of Lord Caitanya, and similarly the last <em>avatāra</em> of this Kali-yuga is also mentioned in the <em>Bhāgavatam.</em> It is mentioned that the last incarnation in this age is Kalki. He will appear as the son of a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> whose name is Viṣṇu-yaśā, in a place called Śambhala. There is a place in India with that name, so perhaps it is there that the Lord will appear.</div></div><div id="bb97463" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So an <em>avatāra</em> must conform to the descriptions in the <em>Upaniṣads, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Mahābhārata,</em> and other Vedic literatures. And on the authority of Vedic literature and the commentary of great, stalwart <em>gosvāmīs</em> like Jīva Gosvāmī, who was the greatest scholar and philosopher in the world, we can accept Lord Caitanya as an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa.</div></div><div id="bb97464" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Why did Lord Caitanya appear? In the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> Lord Kṛṣṇa says, “Give up all other engagements and simply engage in My service. I will give you protection from all results of sinful actions.” In this material world, in conditioned life, we are simply creating sinful reactions. That’s all. And because of sinful reactions, we have received this body. If our sinful reactions stopped we would not have to take a material body; we should get a spiritual body.</div></div><div id="bb97465" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">What is a spiritual body? A spiritual body is a body that is free from death, birth, disease, and old age. It is an eternal body, full of knowledge and bliss. Different bodies are created by different desires. As long as we have desires for different kinds of enjoyment, we have to accept different kinds of material bodies. Kṛṣṇa, God, is so kind that He awards whatever we want. If we want a tiger’s body, with tigerlike strength and teeth with which to capture animals and suck fresh blood, then Kṛṣṇa will give us the opportunity. And if we want the body of a saintly person, a devotee engaged only in the service of the Lord, then He will give us that body. This is stated in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em></div></div><div id="bb97466" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">If a person engaged in yoga, the process of self-realization, somehow or other fails to complete the process, he is given another chance; he is given birth in a family of a pure <em>brāhmaṇa</em> or a rich man. If one is fortunate enough to take birth in such a family, he gets all facilities to understand the importance of self-realization. From the very beginning of life our Kṛṣṇa conscious children are getting the opportunity to learn how to chant and dance, so when they are grown up they will not change, but instead will automatically make progress. They are very fortunate. Regardless of whether he is born in America or Europe, a child will advance if his father and mother are devotees. He gets this opportunity. If a child takes birth in a family of devotees, this means that in his last life he had already taken to the yoga process, but somehow or other he could not finish it. Therefore the child is given another opportunity to make progress under the care of a good father and mother so that he will again advance. In this way, as soon as one completes his development of God consciousness, then he no longer has to take birth in this material world, but returns to the spiritual world.</div></div><div id="bb97467" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Kṛṣṇa says in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā:</em> “My dear Arjuna, if one understands My appearance, disappearance, and activities, simply because of this understanding he is given the opportunity to take birth in the spiritual world after giving up this body.” One has to give up this body – today, tomorrow, or maybe the day after that. One has to. But a person who has understood Kṛṣṇa will not have to take another material body. He goes directly to the spiritual world and takes birth in one of the spiritual planets. So Kṛṣṇa says that as soon as one gets this body – it doesn’t matter if it is from India or the moon or the sun or Brahmaloka or anywhere within this material world – one should know that it is due to his sinful activities. There are degrees of sinful activities, so according to the degree of sinfulness, one takes a material body. Therefore our real problem is not how to eat, sleep, mate, and defend – our real problem is how to get a body that is not material but spiritual. That is the ultimate solution to all problems. So Kṛṣṇa guarantees that if one surrenders unto Him, if one becomes fully Kṛṣṇa conscious, then He will give one protection from all reactions to sinful life.</div></div><div id="bb97468" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">This assurance was given by Kṛṣṇa in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> but there were many fools who could not understand Kṛṣṇa. In the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> they are described as <em>mūḍhas. Mūḍha</em> means “rascal,” and Kṛṣṇa says in the <em>Gītā,</em> “They do not know what I actually am.” So many people misunderstood Kṛṣṇa. Although Kṛṣṇa gave us this message of the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> so that we could understand Him, many people missed the opportunity. Therefore Kṛṣṇa, out of His compassion, came again, as a devotee, and showed us how to surrender unto Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa Himself came to teach us how to surrender. His last instruction in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> is to surrender, but people – <em>mūḍhas,</em> rascals – said, “Why should I surrender?” Therefore, although Caitanya Mahāprabhu is Kṛṣṇa Himself, this time He teaches us practically how to execute the mission of the <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> That’s all. Caitanya Mahāprabhu is teaching nothing extraordinary, nothing beyond the process of surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which was already taught in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> There is no other teaching, but the same teaching is presented in different ways so that different kinds of people may take it and take the opportunity to approach God.</div></div><div id="bb97469" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Caitanya Mahāprabhu gives us the opportunity to reach God directly. When Rūpa Gosvāmī, the principal disciple of Lord Caitanya, first saw Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he was a minister in the government of Bengal but wanted to join Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s movement. So he gave up his position as a minister, and after joining, when he surrendered, he offered a nice prayer to Lord Caitanya. This prayer says:</div></div><div id="bb97470" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic"><em>namo mahā-vadānyāya<br />kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te<br />kṛṣṇāya kṛṣṇa-caitanya-<br />nāmne gaura-tviṣe namaḥ</em></div></div><div id="bb97471" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">“My dear Lord, You are the most munificent of all the incarnations.” Why? <em>Kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te:</em> “You are directly giving love of God.

It is not that one can describe anything or glorify anything and that will be <em>kīrtana.</em> From the grammatical point of view that may be <em>kīrtana,</em> but according to the Vedic system, <em>kīrtana</em> means describing the supreme authority, the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is called <em>kīrtana.</em></div></div><div id="bb97476" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">This devotional service begins with the method of <em>śravaṇa. Śravaṇa</em> means “hearing,” and <em>kīrtana</em> means “describing.” One should describe, and another should hear. Or the same man himself can both describe and hear. He does not need anyone else’s help. When we chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, we chant and hear. This is complete. This is a complete method. But what is that chanting and hearing? One must chant and hear about Viṣṇu, Kṛṣṇa. Not of anything else. <em>Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ:</em> one can understand Viṣṇu, the all-pervading Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by the method of hearing.</div></div><div id="bb97477" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">We have to hear; if one simply hears, that is the beginning. One does not need any education or development of material knowledge. Just like a child: as soon as he hears, immediately he can respond and dance. So by nature God has given us these nice instruments – ears – so that we can hear. But we must hear from the right source. That is stated in the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</em> One must hear from those who are devoted to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They are called <em>satām.</em> If one hears from the right source, from a realized soul, then it will act. And these words of God, or Kṛṣṇa, are very relishable. If one is intelligent enough, he will listen to what is spoken by the realized soul. Then very soon he will be released from material entanglements.</div></div><div id="bb97478" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">This human life is meant for advancing on the path of liberation. That is called <em>apavarga,</em> freedom from entanglement. We are all entangled. Our acceptance of this material body means that we are already entangled. But we should not progress in the process of entanglement. That process is called karma. As long as the mind is absorbed in karma, we will have to accept a material body. At the time of death, our mind may be thinking, “Oh, I could not complete this work. Oh, I am dying! I have to do this. I have to do that.” This means that Kṛṣṇa will give us another chance to do it, and so we will have to accept another body. He will give us the chance: “All right. You could not do it. <em>Now</em> do it. Take this body.” Therefore the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> says, “These rascals have become madly intoxicated; because of intoxication they are doing something they should not have done.” What are they doing? Mahārāja Dhṛtarāṣṭra is a very good example. Mahārāja Dhṛtarāṣṭra was cunningly planning to kill the Pāṇḍavas in order to favor his own sons, so Kṛṣṇa sent His uncle, Akrūra, to advise him not to do that. Dhṛtarāṣṭra understood Akrūra’s instructions, but he said, “My dear Akrūra, what you are saying is quite right, but it does not stand in my heart, so I cannot change my policy.

For example, there have been many instances in material life where someone has become mad after something and has committed a criminal act such as murder. The person could not check himself. Similarly, we are accustomed to sense gratification. We are mad, and therefore our minds are fully absorbed in karma. This is very unfortunate, because our body, although temporary, is the reservoir of all misfortunes and miseries; it is always giving us trouble. These matters are to be studied. We should not be mad. Human life is not meant for that. The defect of the present civilization is that people are mad after sense gratification. That is all. They do not know the real value of life, and therefore they are neglecting the most valuable form of life, this human form.</div></div><div id="bb97480" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">When this body is finished there is no guarantee what kind of body one will take next. Suppose in my next life I by chance get the body of a tree. For thousands of years I will have to stand up. But people are not very serious. They even say, “What is that? Even if I have to stand up, I shall forget.” The lower species of life are situated in forgetfulness. If a tree were not forgetful it would be impossible for it to live. Suppose we were told, “You stand up for three days here!” Because we are not forgetful, we would become mad. So, by nature’s law, all these lower species of life are forgetful. Their consciousness is not developed. A tree has life, but even if someone cuts it, because its consciousness is not developed, it does not respond. So we should be very careful to utilize this human form of life properly. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant for achieving perfection in life. It is not a bluff or exploitation, but unfortunately people are accustomed to being bluffed. There is a verse by an Indian poet: “If one speaks nice things, people will quarrel with him: ’Oh, what nonsense you are speaking.’ But if he bluffs them and cheats them, they will be very glad.” So if a bluffer says, “Just do this, give me my fee, and within six months you will become God,” then they will agree: “Yes, take this fee, and I shall become God within six months.” No. These cheating processes will not solve our problem. If one actually wants to solve the problems of life in this age, then he has to take to this process of <em>kīrtana.</em> That is the recommended process.</div></div><div id="bb97481" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic"><em>harer nāma harer nāma<br />harer nāmaiva kevalam<br />kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva<br />nāsty eva gatir anyathā</em></div></div><div id="bb97482" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In this age, Kali-yuga, one cannot execute any process of self-realization or perfection of life other than <em>kīrtana.

But there are different processes of meditation recommended for different ages. The process of mystic yogic meditation was possible in Satya-yuga, when men lived for many thousands of years. Now people will not believe this, but in a previous age there were people who lived for one hundred thousand years. That age was called Satya-yuga, and the meditation of mystic yoga was possible at that time. In that age the great yogi Vālmīki Muni meditated for sixty thousand years. So that is a long-term process, which is not possible to execute in this age. If one wishes to conduct a farce, that is another matter. But if one actually wants to practice such meditation, it takes an extremely long time to perfect. In the next age, Tretā-yuga, the process of realization was to perform the various ritualistic sacrifices recommended in the <em>Vedas.</em> In the next age, Dvāpara-yuga, the process was temple worship. In this present age the same result can be achieved by the process of <em>hari-kīrtana,</em> glorification of Hari, Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div></div><div id="bb97484" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">No other <em>kīrtana</em> is recommended. This <em>hari-kīrtana</em> was started five hundred years ago in Bengal by Lord Caitanya. In Bengal there is competition between the Vaiṣṇavas and the <em>śāktas.</em> The <em>śāktas</em> have introduced a certain type of <em>kīrtana</em> called <em>kālī-kīrtana.</em> But in the Vedic scriptures there is no recommendation of <em>kālī-kīrtana. Kīrtana</em> means <em>hari-kīrtana.</em> One cannot say, “Oh, you are Vaiṣṇava. You can perform <em>hari-kīrtana.</em> I shall perform <em>śiva-kīrtana</em> or <em>devī-kīrtana</em> or <em>gaṇeśa-kīrtana.</em>” No. The Vedic scriptures do not authorize any <em>kīrtana</em> other than <em>hari-kīrtana. Kīrtana</em> means <em>hari-kīrtana,</em> the glorification of Kṛṣṇa.</div></div><div id="bb97485" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So this process of <em>hari-kīrtana</em> is very simple: Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. Actually there are only three words: <em>Hare, Kṛṣṇa,</em> and <em>Rāma.</em> But they are very nicely arranged for chanting so that everyone can take the mantra and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare. Since we have started this movement in the Western countries, Europeans, Americans, Africans, Egyptians, and Japanese are all chanting. There is no difficulty. They are chanting very gladly, and they are getting the results. What is the difficulty? We are distributing this chanting free of charge, and it is very simple. Simply by chanting, one can have self-realization, God realization, and when there is God realization, then nature realization is included also. For example, if one learns one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and zero, then he has studied the entirety of mathematics, because mathematics means simply changing the places of these ten figures. That’s all. Similarly, if one simply studies Kṛṣṇa, then all his knowledge is perfect. And Kṛṣṇa is easily understood simply by chanting this <em>mantra,</em> Hare Kṛṣṇa. So why not take this opportunity?</div></div><div id="bb97486" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Take this opportunity that is being offered to human society. It is very ancient and scientific. It is not that it is a concoction that will last for only three or four years. No. In the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> Kṛṣṇa Himself says, “This philosophy is inexhaustible and indestructible. It is never lost or destroyed.” It may be covered for the time being, but it is never destroyed. Therefore it is called <em>avyayam. Vyaya</em> means “exhaustion.” For example, one may have a hundred dollars, and if they are spent one after another, the next day it will come to zero. That is <em>vyaya,</em> exhaustible. But Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not like that. If you cultivate this knowledge of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then it will increase. That is certified by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. <em>Ānandāmbudhi-vardhanam. Ānanda</em> means “pleasure,” “transcendental bliss,” and <em>ambudhi</em> means “ocean.” In the material world we see that the ocean does not increase. But if one cultivates Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then his transcendental bliss will simply increase. <em>Ānandāmbudhi-vardhanam.</em> And I shall always remind everyone that the process is very simple. Anyone can chant, anywhere, without taxation or loss, but the gain is very great.</div></div><div id="bb97487" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has explained this <em>kīrtana</em> movement in His <em>Śikṣāṣṭaka.

The Lord says, <em>ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam:</em> one should cleanse the heart. I have explained this several times, but it does not become monotonous. It is just like the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa; it does not become tiresome. Our students can chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra twenty-four hours a day, and they will never get tired. They will continue to dance and chant. And anyone can try it; because it is not material, one will never get tired of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. In the material world, if one chants anything, any favorite name, for three, four, or ten times, he will get tired of it. That is a fact. But because Hare Kṛṣṇa is not material, if one chants this mantra, he will never get tired. The more one chants, the more his heart will be cleansed of material dirt and the more the problems of his life within this material world will be solved.</div></div><div id="bb97488" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">What is the problem of our lives? That we do not know. Modern education never gives enlightenment about the real problem of life. That is indicated in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> Those who are educated and are advancing in knowledge should know what is the problem of life. This problem is stated in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā:</em> one should always see the inconveniences of birth, death, old age, and disease. Unfortunately no one pays attention to these problems. When a man is diseased he thinks, “All right. Let me go to the doctor. He will give me some medicine, and I will be cured.” But he does not consider the problem very seriously. “I did not want this disease. Why is there disease? Is it not possible to become free from disease?” He never thinks that way. This is because his intelligence is very low-grade, just like that of an animal. An animal suffers, but it has no sense. If an animal is brought to a slaughterhouse and sees that the animal before him is being slaughtered, he will still stand there contentedly eating the grass. This is animal life. He does not know that next time it will be his turn and he will be slaughtered. I have seen it. In a Kālī temple I have seen that a goat was standing there ready to be sacrificed and another goat was very happily eating the grass.</div></div><div id="bb97489" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Similarly, Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was asked by Yamarāja, “What is the most wonderful thing in this world?

The most wonderful thing is that at every moment one can see that his friends, his fathers, and his relatives have died, but he is thinking, ’I shall live forever.’” He never thinks that he will die, just as an animal never thinks that at the next moment he may be slaughtered. He is satisfied with the grass, that’s all. He is satisfied with the sense gratification.

People do not take this problem seriously, but the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> indicates that that is real education. Real education is to inquire why, although we do not want to die, death comes. That is real inquiry. We do not want to become old men. Why does old age come upon us? We have many problems, but this is the sum and substance of all of them.</div></div><div id="bb97491" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In order to solve this problem, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu prescribes the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa. As soon as our heart is cleansed by chanting this Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, the blazing fire of our problematic material existence is extinguished. How is it extinguished? When we cleanse our heart we will realize that we do not belong to this material world. Because people are identifying with this material world, they are thinking, “I am an Indian,” ”I am an Englishman,” ”I am this,” ”I am that.” But if one chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, he will realize that he is not this material body. “I do not belong to this material body or this material world. I am a spirit soul, part and parcel of the Supreme. I am eternally related with Him, and I have nothing to do with the material world.” This is called liberation, knowledge. If I don’t have anything to do with this material world, then I am liberated. And that knowledge is called <em>brahma-bhūta.</em></div></div><div id="bb97492" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">A person with this realization has no duty to perform. Because we are now identifying our existence with this material world, we have so many duties. The <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> says that as long as there is no self-realization, we have so many duties and debts. We are indebted to the demigods. The demigods are not merely fictitious. They are real. There are demigods controlling the sun, the moon, and the air. Just as there are directors of government departments, so for the heating department there is the sun-god, for the air department there is Vāyu, and similarly there are other departmental demigods. In the <em>Vedas</em> they are described as controlling deities, so we cannot neglect them. Also, there are great sages and philosophers who have given us knowledge, and we are indebted to them. So as soon as we take birth we are indebted to so many living entities, but it is impossible to liquidate all these debts. Therefore the Vedic literature recommends that one take shelter of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. And Kṛṣṇa says, “If one takes shelter of Me, then he doesn’t have to take shelter of anyone else.”</div></div><div id="bb97493" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Therefore those who are Kṛṣṇa conscious devotees have taken shelter of Kṛṣṇa, and the beginning is hearing and chanting. <em>Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ.</em> So our fervent, humble request to everyone is to please accept this chanting. This movement of Kṛṣṇa consciousness was introduced by Lord Caitanya five hundred years ago in Bengal, and now all over India and especially in Bengal there are millions of followers of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Now this movement is starting in the Western countries, so just be very serious in understanding it. We do not criticize any other religion. Don’t take it in that way. We have no business criticizing any other process of religion. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is giving people the most sublime religion – love of God. That’s all. We are teaching to love God. Everyone is already loving, but that love is misplaced. We love this boy or this girl or this country or that society or even the cats and dogs, but we are not satisfied.

We don’t have to learn to love anything else; everything else is automatically included. Just try to love God. Don’t try to love just trees or plants or insects. This will never satisfy.

A little elevated from this speculative status, when one is intelligent enough, one tries to find out the supreme cause of all causes – within and without.

This chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra is enacted from the spiritual platform, and thus this sound vibration surpasses all lower strata of consciousness – namely sensual, mental, and intellectual. There is no need, therefore, to understand the language of the mantra, nor is there any need for mental speculation nor any intellectual adjustment for chanting this <em>mahā-mantra.</em> It is automatic, from the spiritual platform, and as such, anyone can take part in the chanting without any previous qualification. In a more advanced stage, of course, one is not expected to commit offenses on the grounds of spiritual understanding.</div></div><div id="bb97500" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the beginning, there may not be the presence of all transcendental ecstasies, which are eight in number. These are: (1) being stopped as though dumb, (2) perspiration, (3) standing up of hairs on the body, (4) dislocation of voice, (5) trembling, (6) fading of the body, (7) crying in ecstasy, and (8) trance. But there is no doubt that chanting for a while takes one immediately to the spiritual platform, and one shows the first symptom of this in the urge to dance along with the chanting of the mantra. We have seen this practically. Even a child can take part in the chanting and dancing. Of course, for one who is too entangled in material life, it takes a little more time to come to the standard point, but even such a materially engrossed man is raised to the spiritual platform very quickly. When the mantra is chanted by a pure devotee of the Lord in love, it has the greatest efficacy on hearers, and as such this chanting should be heard from the lips of a pure devotee of the Lord, so that immediate effects can be achieved. As far as possible, chanting from the lips of nondevotees should be avoided. Milk touched by the lips of a serpent has poisonous effects.</div></div><div id="bb97501" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The word <em>Harā</em> is the form of addressing the energy of the Lord, and the words <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> and <em>Rāma</em> are forms of addressing the Lord Himself.

It was not that He manufactured some religious system, just as nowadays so many religious systems are being manufactured. Actually, religion cannot be manufactured. <em>Dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam.</em> Religion means the codes of God, the laws of God, that’s all. Certainly we cannot live without obeying the state laws, and similarly we cannot live without obeying the laws of God. And in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> [4.7] the Lord says that whenever there are discrepancies in the prosecution of religious activities (<em>yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata</em>) and there is a predominance of irreligious activities (<em>abhyutthānam adharmasya</em>), at that time I [Kṛṣṇa] appear (<em>tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham</em>). And in the material world we can see the same principle demonstrated, for whenever there is disobedience of state laws, there is the advent of some particular state officer or policeman to “set things right.”</div></div><div id="bb97509" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu is worshiped by the Gosvāmīs.

Go</em> means “land,” <em>go</em> means “cow,” and <em>go</em> means “senses.” And <em>svāmī</em> means “master.” So <em>gosvāmī</em> means that they were masters of the senses. When one becomes master of the senses, or <em>gosvāmī,</em> he can make progress in spiritual life. That is the real meaning of <em>svāmī.

Our <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement was first introduced in New York in 1966. At that time I came and began to chant this Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra in Tompkins Square. I was chanting there for three hours with a small <em>mṛdaṅga</em> [drum], and these American boys assembled and gradually joined, and so it is increasing. First of all it was started in a New York storefront, 26 Second Avenue, then we started our branches in San Francisco, Montreal, Boston, Los Angeles, Buffalo, Columbus. We now [1970] have twenty-four branches, including one in London and one in Hamburg. In London they are all American boys and girls, and they are preaching. They are not <em>sannyāsīs,</em> nor are they Vedāntists, nor Hindus, nor Indians, but they have taken this movement very seriously. Even in the London <em>Times</em> there was an article headlined, “Kṛṣṇa Chant Startles London.” So we have many in the movement now. All my disciples, at least in this country, are Americans and Europeans. They are chanting, dancing, and distributing a magazine, <em>Back to Godhead.</em> Now we have published many books – the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Bhagavad-gītā As It Is, Teachings of Lord Caitanya,</em> and <em>Īśopaniṣad.</em> It is not that this movement is simply a sentimental movement. Don’t think that these boys are dancing out of some religious sentiment or fanaticism. No. We have the highest philosophical and theosophical background.</div></div><div id="bb97519" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">As an illustration, let us consider Caitanya Mahāprabhu. While He was preaching, He went to Benares, the seat of Māyāvādī <em>sannyāsīs.</em> The followers of Śaṅkarācārya are mostly seen in Benares. When Caitanya Mahāprabhu was there, He was chanting and dancing. Some of the people very much appreciated this, and so He quickly became famous. One prominent <em>sannyāsī,</em> Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, leader of many thousands of Māyāvādī <em>sannyāsīs,</em> was informed: “Oh, from Bengal one young <em>sannyāsī</em> has come. He is so nicely chanting and dancing.” Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī was a great Vedāntist, and he did not like the idea. He said, “Oh, he is a pseudo <em>sannyāsī.</em> He is chanting and dancing, and this is not the business of a <em>sannyāsī.</em> A <em>sannyāsī</em> should always engage himself in the study of philosophy and the <em>Vedānta.</em>”</div></div><div id="bb97520" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Then one of the devotees who did not like the remarks of Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī came back and informed Lord Caitanya that He was being criticized. So the devotee arranged a meeting of all the <em>sannyāsīs,</em> and there was a philosophical discussion on the <em>Vedānta</em> between Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī and Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. These accounts and philosophical discussions are given in our <em>Teachings of Lord Caitanya.</em> It is remarkable that Prakāśānanda himself and all his disciples became Vaiṣṇavas.</div></div><div id="bb97521" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s movement is not mere sentimentalism. Caitanya Mahāprabhu had a great discussion with Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, the greatest logician of that time, who was also Māyāvādī, impersonalist, and he was also converted. There is a very rich background if one wants to understand this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement through philosophy and logic. There is ample opportunity, for this movement is based on science and on the authority of the <em>Vedas.</em> But it is all simplified. That is the beauty of this movement. Whether one is a great scholar or philosopher or a child, he can take part without any difficulty. Other systems of self-realization, the <em>jñāna</em> process or yoga process, are also recognized, but it is not possible to practice them in this age. That is the verdict of the <em>Vedas:</em></div></div><div id="bb97522" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic"><em>kṛte yad dhyāyato viṣṇuṁ<br />tretāyāṁ yajato makhaiḥ<br />dvāpare paricaryāyāṁ<br />kalau tad dhari-kīrtanāt</em></div></div><div id="bb97523" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-right">[<a href="/en/library/sb/12/3/52/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> 12.3.52</a>]</div></div><div id="bb97524" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the Satya-yuga, the Golden Age, it was possible to execute the meditation process. For instance, Vālmīki Muni meditated for sixty thousand years to get perfection. But where is our old age? Besides that, for the meditation process, as described in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> one has to select a secluded place, he has to execute it alone, he has to sit down in a rigid posture, he has to lead a life of complete celibacy, and so on. There are many rules and regulations. Thus <em>aṣṭāṅga-yoga</em> meditation is not possible. If one is satisfied by imitating, that is a different thing, but if one wants perfection, then he has to execute all the eight stages of <em>aṣṭāṅga-yoga.</em> If this is not possible, then it is a waste of time.</div></div><div id="bb97525" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">What is the ultimate goal of the yoga process or meditation? Contact with the Supreme, the Supersoul, the Supreme Lord, is the aim and object of all yoga processes. Similarly, philosophical research, the <em>jñāna</em> process, also aims at understanding the Supreme Brahman. These are recognized processes, undoubtedly, but according to authoritative description, they are not practical in this Iron Age of Kali. Therefore one has to take to this process of <em>hari-kīrtana.</em> Anyone can practice without prequalification. One doesn’t have to study philosophy or Vedānta. This was the purport of Lord Caitanya’s meeting with Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī.</div></div><div id="bb97526" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">When the Vedānta philosophy was thoroughly discussed between Lord Caitanya and Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī first of all asked Caitanya Mahāprabhu, “I understand that You were a very good scholar in Your early life. [Lord Caitanya was actually a very great scholar. His name was Nimāi Paṇḍita, and at the age of sixteen He defeated a great scholar from Kashmir, Keśava Kāśmīrī.] And I understand that You are a great Sanskrit scholar, and that especially in logic You are a very learned scholar. You were also born in a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> family, and now You are a <em>sannyāsī.</em> How is it that You are chanting and dancing and not reading the Vedānta?” This was the first question asked by Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, and Lord Caitanya replied, “Yes, the reason is that when I was initiated by My spiritual master, he said that I am fool number one. ’You don’t discuss the Vedānta,’ he told Me. ’You will simply spoil Your time. Just take to this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, and You will be successful.’” That was his reply. Of course, Caitanya Mahāprabhu was not a fool, and certainly the Vedānta is not for fools. One needs sufficient education, and one must attain a certain status before he can understand the Vedānta. In each and every word there are volumes of meanings, and there are many commentaries by Śaṅkarācārya and Rāmānujācārya, huge volumes in Sanskrit. But how can we understand Vedānta? It is not possible. It <em>may</em> be possible for one person or two persons to understand, but for the mass of people it is not possible. Nor is it possible to practice yoga. Therefore, if one takes to Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s method, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, the first installment of gain will be <em>ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam:</em> all the dirty things will be cleansed from the heart simply by chanting. Chant. There is no expenditure and there is no loss. If one simply chants for one week, he will see how much he will progress in spiritual knowledge.</div></div><div id="bb97527" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">We are attracting many students simply by chanting, and they are understanding the entire philosophy and becoming purified. This Society was started only four years ago, in 1966, and we have so many branches already. The American boys and girls are taking it very seriously, and they are happy. Ask any one of them. <em>Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam.</em> They are cleansing the dirty things from the heart simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.</div></div><div id="bb97528" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The next point is <em>bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇam:</em> as soon as the heart is cleansed of all dirty things, then all the problems of material existence are immediately solved. This world has been compared to <em>dāvāgni,</em> which means a blazing fire in the forest. In this material existence no one wants unhappiness, but it comes by force. That is the law of material nature. No one wants fire, but wherever we go in a city the fire brigade is always active. There is always fire. Similarly, there are many things that no one wants. No one wants death – there is death. No one wants disease – there is disease. No one wants old age – there is old age.

The human being should learn <em>tapasya.</em> Especially in India, so many great sages, so many great kings, and so many <em>brahmacārīs</em> and <em>sannyāsīs</em> have passed their lives in great <em>tapasya</em> in order not to go further to sleep. Lord Buddha was a prince who gave up everything and engaged himself in <em>tapasya.</em> This is life. When King Bhārata, under whose name India was named Bhārata-varṣa, was twenty-four years old, he gave up his kingdom, his young wife, and young children and went away for <em>tapasya.</em> When Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu was only twenty-four, He gave up His young wife, mother, everything. There are many, many examples. India is the land of <em>tapasya,</em> but we are forgetting that. Now we are making it the land of technology. It is surprising that India is now no longer propagating this <em>tapasya,</em> for India is the land of <em>dharma: dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre.</em></div></div><div id="bb97533" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">But it is not only in India; everywhere in this age of iron everything is degraded, degraded in this sense: <em>prāyeṇālpāyuṣaḥ sabhya kalāv asmin yuge janāḥ</em> [<a href="/en/library/sb/1/1/10/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> 1.1.10</a>]. In this age of Kali the duration of life is diminished, and men are not moved to understand self-realization, and if they are, they are invariably misled by so many deceitful leaders.

No. This is open for everyone – children, women, girls, boys, old people – everyone can chant and see the results.</div></div><div id="bb97538" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">To further this end we not only are establishing New Vrindavan, our farm project in West Virginia, but are establishing other spiritual communities, such as New Navadvīpa and New Jagannātha Purī. We have already started New Jagannātha Purī in San Francisco, and the Ratha-yātrā festival is going on. This year there will be a great ceremony of Ratha-yātrā in London also. There will be three cars, for Jagannātha, Subhadrā, and Balarāma, and they will be taken to the river Thames. And America has imported New England and New York, so why not New Vrindavan? We should especially establish this New Vrindavan, because Lord Caitanya recommended, <em>ārādhyo bhagavān vrajeśa-tanayas tad-dhāma vṛndāvanam:</em> “Kṛṣṇa, the son of Nanda Mahārāja in Vṛndāvana-dhāma, or Vraja-bhūmi, is the supreme worshipable Deity, and His place Vṛndāvana is also worshipable.” The Western boys and girls are taking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and they should have a place like Vṛndāvana. Swami Kīrtanānanda, who went to Vṛndāvana with me two years ago, knows what Vṛndāvana is like, so I have instructed him to construct at least seven temples. In Vṛndāvana, there are five thousand temples of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, but the most important temples are seven, established by the Gosvāmīs. Our program is to live in New Vrindavan, depend on agriculture and cows as an economic solution, and peacefully execute Kṛṣṇa consciousness, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa – that is the Vṛndāvana scheme. <em>Yuktāhāra-vihārasya … yogo bhavati duḥkha-hā</em> [<a href="/en/library/bg/6/17/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> 6.17</a>]. This human form of life isn’t meant for increasing artificial needs. We should be satisfied just to maintain the body and soul together, and the rest of the time we should enhance our Kṛṣṇa consciousness, so that after leaving this body we won’t have to take another material body, but will be able to go back home, back to Godhead. That should be the motto of human life.</div></div><div id="bb97539" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Material life means eating, sleeping, mating, and defending, and spiritual life means something more than this. This is also the difference between animal life and human life. In animal life, the common formula is eating, sleeping, mating, and defending. A dog eats, a man also eats. A man sleeps, and a dog also sleeps. A man has sex, and the dog also has sex. The dog defends in his own way, and man also defends in his own way, maybe by atomic bombs. These four principles are common to human beings and animals, and advancement of these four principles is not human civilization but animal civilization. Human civilization means <em>athāto brahma-jijñāsā.</em> In the <em>Vedānta-sūtra</em> the first aphorism is <em>athāto brahma-jijñāsā:</em> “Now is the time for inquiry about Brahman.” That is human life. As long as one is not spiritually inquisitive, <em>jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam,</em> he is an animal, because he lives according to these four principles, that’s all. He must be inquisitive to know what he is and why he is put into these miseries of birth, death, old age, and disease. Is there any remedy? These matters should be questioned. That is human life; that is spiritual life.</div></div><div id="bb97540" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Spiritual life means human life, and material life means animal life. That’s all. We have to make the adjustments that are recommended in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā. Yuktāhāra-vihārasya.</em> For instance, because I am going to be a spiritual man does not mean that I shall give up eating. Rather, my eating should be adjusted. The <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> describes what class of food is first class, in goodness, and what class of food is in passion, and third class, in ignorance. We have to raise ourselves to the sattvic (goodness) platform of human civilization, then revive our transcendental consciousness, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Everything is there in the <em>śāstras.</em> Unfortunately, we do not consult them.</div></div><div id="bb97541" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic"><em>evaṁ prasanna-manaso<br />bhagavad-bhakti-yogataḥ<br />bhagavat-tattva-vijñānaṁ<br />mukta-saṅgasya jāyate</em></div></div><div id="bb97542" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-right">[<a href="/en/library/sb/1/2/20/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> 1.2.20</a>]</div></div><div id="bb97543" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Unless one is liberated from the clutches of these three modes of material nature, he cannot understand God. <em>Prasanna-manasaḥ.</em> One must be a Brahman-realized soul. <em>Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati</em> [<a href="/en/library/bg/18/54/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> 18.54</a>].

We are facing so many problems only because of this forgetfulness. If we can revive our original God consciousness, then we shall become happy. This is the sum and substance of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is the best process by which to revive our original God consciousness. There are different processes of self-realization, but in the present age of Kali, people are very fallen, and they require the simple process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Now they are thinking that so-called material advancement is the solution to their problems, but this is not a fact. The real solution is to get out of the material condition entirely by becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious. Because God is eternal, we are also eternal, but in the material condition we are thinking, “I am this body,” and therefore we must repeatedly change from body to body. This is due to ignorance. Actually we are not our bodies but spiritual sparks, parts and parcels of God.</div></div><div id="bb97549" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Mr. Faill: </strong>Then the body is just like a vehicle for the soul?</div></div><div id="bb97550" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Śrīla Prabhupāda: </strong>Yes.

But nothing will make us happy unless we come to our real position, which is that we are all parts and parcels of God and that our real business is to associate with God and help all living entities by cooperating with Him. Civilized human life is attained only after a long evolution through 8,400,000 species of life. So if we don’t take advantage of this civilized human life to understand who God is, who we are, and what our relationship is, but instead simply waste our life like cats and dogs, going here and there looking for sense gratification, then we will have missed a great opportunity. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant to teach people how to take full advantage of the human form of life by trying to understand God and our relationship with Him.</div></div><div id="bb97551" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Mr. Faill: </strong>If we don’t make the most of this life, do we get a second chance, in another life?</div></div><div id="bb97552" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Śrīla Prabhupāda: </strong>Yes. According to your desires at the time of death, you get another body. That body is not guaranteed to be a human body, however. As I’ve already explained, there are 8,400,000 different forms of life. You can enter any of them, according to your mental condition at death. What we think of at the time of death depends on how we act during our life. As long as we are in material consciousness, our actions are under the control of the material nature, which is being conducted in three modes: goodness, passion, and ignorance. These modes are like the three basic colors – yellow, red, and blue. Just as one can mix red, yellow, and blue to produce millions of colors, the modes of nature are being mixed to produce many varieties of life.</div></div><div id="bb97553" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">To stop the repetition of birth and death in different forms of life, we must transcend the covering of material nature and come to the platform of pure consciousness. But if we do not learn the transcendental science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then at death we must transfer to another body, either better or worse than our present one. If we cultivate the mode of goodness, then we are promoted to the higher planetary system, where there is a better standard of life. If we cultivate the mode of passion, then we will remain at the present stage. But if out of ignorance we commit sinful activities and violate nature’s laws, then we will be degraded to animal or plant life. Then again we must evolve to the human form, a process that may take millions of years. Therefore a human being must be responsible. He must take advantage of the rare opportunity of human life by understanding his relationship with God and acting accordingly. Then he can get out of the cycle of birth and death in different forms of life and go back home, back to Godhead.</div></div><div id="bb97554" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Mr. Faill: </strong>Do you think transcendental meditation is helping people?</div></div><div id="bb97555" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Śrīla Prabhupāda: </strong>They do not know what real meditation is.

I think you have a saying, “You are what you eat,” and that’s a fact. Our bodily constitution and mental atmosphere are determined according to how and what we eat. Therefore the <em>śāstras</em> recommend that to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, you should eat remnants of food left by Kṛṣṇa. If a tuberculosis patient eats something and you eat the remnants, you will be infected with tuberculosis. Similarly, if you eat <em>kṛṣṇa-prasāda,</em> then you will be infected with Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Thus our process is that we don’t eat anything immediately. First we offer the food to Kṛṣṇa, then we eat it. This helps us advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div></div><div id="bb97593" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Mr. Faill: </strong>You are all vegetarians?</div></div><div id="bb97594" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Śrīla Prabhupāda: </strong>Yes, because Kṛṣṇa is a vegetarian. Kṛṣṇa can eat anything because He is God, but in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> [9.26] He says, “If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit, or water, I will accept it.” He never says, “Give Me meat and wine.”</div></div><div id="bb97595" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Mr. Faill: </strong>How about the tobacco question?</div></div><div id="bb97596" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Śrīla Prabhupāda: </strong>Tobacco is also an intoxicant.

Similarly, we also have a prescription for being cured of the bodily conception of life: chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, hearing about Kṛṣṇa’s activities, and eating <em>kṛṣṇa-prasāda.</em> This treatment is the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div></div><div class="mt-10 flex justify-between"><a href="/en/library/ssr/4/" class="inline-flex font-sans items-center px-4 py-2 mr-4 text-base font-medium bg-vb-header-top bg-opacity-30 border border-vb-header-top border-opacity-30 rounded-lg hover:bg-opacity-50"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 448 512" class="mr-2" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M257.5 445.1l-22.2 22.2c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0L7 273c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9L201.4 44.7c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0l22.2 22.2c9.5 9.5 9.3 25-.4 34.3L136.6 216H424c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24v32c0 13.3-10.7 24-24 24H136.6l120.5 114.8c9.8 9.3 10 24.8.4 34.3z"></path></svg>Chapter Four</a><a href="/en/library/ssr/6/" class="inline-flex font-sans items-center px-4 py-2 text-base font-medium bg-vb-header-top bg-opacity-30 border border-vb-header-top border-opacity-30 rounded-lg hover:bg-opacity-50">Chapter Six<svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 448 512" class="ml-2" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M190.5 66.9l22.2-22.2c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0L441 239c9.4 9.4 9.4 24.6 0 33.9L246.6 467.3c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0l-22.2-22.2c-9.5-9.5-9.3-25 .4-34.3L311.4 296H24c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24v-32c0-13.3 10.7-24 24-24h287.4L190.9 101.2c-9.8-9.3-10-24.8-.4-34.3z"></path></svg></a></div></main></div><div id="footer" class="mt-auto pt-3 mb-6 text-sm text-vb-normal-text/80 text-center"><div class="px-4 py-4 w-full max-w-screen-xl mx-auto md:px-8 text-sm text-vb-normal-text/80"><div class="py-2 px-3 border border-dashed border-vb-normal-text/15 text-justify relative "><a href="/en/donate/" class="z-20 float-right my-2 ml-3 w-auto border border-vb-action-border bg-vb-action-bg hover:bg-vb-action-bg/80 rounded-md text-vb-action-text py-3 px-6 text-center disabled:opacity-50">Donate</a><span class="flex-grow">Thanks to <span>Vinod Bapat and Meenal Bapat; Mahavisnupriya dasi &amp; Gostavihari das;   Kuldip Persaud; Gagan Kangovi; Rajendra and Geeta Ramchandani; NIOS - North American Institute for Oriental and Classical Studies; Jaykumar Prabhakar; Anantha SriSimha das, Spore; Bharat Vyas; HG Lakshmipati Narayan Das; HG Ragatmika Gopika Devi Dasi; Shri Chander Mohan Gilhotra; HG Prashant Mukund Das; Shri Trilok Singh Grover; Aneesh Koppula; Ronak Talati; Bhargav Ashok; J.K Ahuja; Akiralali; Radhapati Das; Bimal Gupta; Rajasa das; Aishwarya Balaraj; Yogendra Sharad Puranik; Riya and Tejal Chopade; Devarajula Pradeep Kumar (Saroornagar, Hyderabad); Late Chetana Dilip Bhatt; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/indradyumna-swami">Indradyumna Swami</a>; Sachin; Geetanjali Nath; Mario; Joeie; Susheela and Rama Krishna Reddy Patlolla; Jai Devaki Parks; Ashmi Chakraborty; Hari-kirtana das; Ramesta das; Prasad Buddhavarapu; dasa; Kresna Sucandra; Late Mr. S.

And who worships Him? The process is very simple. Just keep a picture of Lord Caitanya with His associates. Lord Caitanya is in the middle, accompanied by His principal associates – Nityānanda, Advaita, Gadādhara, and Śrīvāsa. One simply has to keep this picture. One can keep it anywhere. It is not that one has to come to us to see this picture. Anyone can have this picture in hi"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"s home, chant this Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, and thus worship Lord Caitanya. That is the simple method. But who will capture this simple method? Those who have good brains. Without much bother, if one simply keeps a picture of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu at home and chants Hare Kṛṣṇa, then one will realize God. Anyone can adopt this simple method. There is no expenditure, there is no tax, nor is there any need to build a very big church or temple. Anyone, anywhere, can sit down on the road or beneath a tree and chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra and worship God. Therefore it is a great opportunity. For example, in business or political life one sometimes finds a great opportunity. Those who are intelligent politicians take a good opportunity and make a success of it the first time it comes. Similarly, in this age, those who have sufficient intelligence take to this \u003cem\u003esaṅkīrtana\u003c/em\u003e movement, and they advance very quickly.2e:T451,We have to take Kṛṣṇa’s word as it is. For example, we teach small children that beyond England there are other places, called Germany, India, etc., and the child has to learn about these places from the version of the teacher because they are beyond his sphere. Similarly, beyond this material sky there is another sky. One cannot experiment to find it, any more than a small child can experiment to find Germany or India. That is not possible. If we want to get knowledge, then we have to accept authority. Similarly, if we want to know what is beyond the material world, then we have to accept the Vedic authority. Otherwise there is no possibility of knowing. It is beyond material knowledge. One cannot go to the far planets in this universe, what to speak of going beyond this universe. The estimation is that in order to go to the highest planet of this universe with modern machinery one would have to travel for forty thousand years. So we cannot even travel within this material sky. Our lifetime and means are so limited that we cannot have proper knowledge of even this materi"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"al world.2f:T512,In the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā,\u003c/em\u003e when Arjuna asked Kṛṣṇa, “Will You kindly explain the extent to which Your energies are working?” the Supreme Lord gave him so many instances, and at the end He finally said, “My dear Arjuna, what shall I explain about My energies? It is not actually possible for you to understand. But you can just imagine the expansion of My energies: this material world, which consists of millions of universes, is a display of only one fourth of My creation.” We cannot estimate the position of even one universe, and there are millions of universes. Then beyond that is the spiritual sky, and there are millions of spiritual planets. All this information is available from the Vedic literature. If one accepts Vedic literature, then he can get this knowledge. If one doesn’t accept it, there is no other means. That is our choice. Therefore, according to Vedic civilization, whenever an \u003cem\u003eācārya\u003c/em\u003e speaks he immediately gives references from the Vedic literature. Then others will accept it: “Yes, it is correct.” In a law court the lawyer gives references from past judgments of the court, and if his case is tight, the judge accepts. Similarly, if one can give evidence from the \u003cem\u003eVedas,\u003c/em\u003e then it is understood that his position is factual.30:T4bd,If a person engaged in yoga, the process of self-realization, somehow or other fails to complete the process, he is given another chance; he is given birth in a family of a pure \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa\u003c/em\u003e or a rich man. If one is fortunate enough to take birth in such a family, he gets all facilities to understand the importance of self-realization. From the very beginning of life our Kṛṣṇa conscious children are getting the opportunity to learn how to chant and dance, so when they are grown up they will not change, but instead will automatically make progress. They are very fortunate. Regardless of whether he is born in America or Europe, a child will advance if his father and mother are devotees. He gets this oppo"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"rtunity. If a child takes birth in a family of devotees, this means that in his last life he had already taken to the yoga process, but somehow or other he could not finish it. Therefore the child is given another opportunity to make progress under the care of a good father and mother so that he will again advance. In this way, as soon as one completes his development of God consciousness, then he no longer has to take birth in this material world, but returns to the spiritual world.31:T4e1,Kṛṣṇa says in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā:\u003c/em\u003e “My dear Arjuna, if one understands My appearance, disappearance, and activities, simply because of this understanding he is given the opportunity to take birth in the spiritual world after giving up this body.” One has to give up this body – today, tomorrow, or maybe the day after that. One has to. But a person who has understood Kṛṣṇa will not have to take another material body. He goes directly to the spiritual world and takes birth in one of the spiritual planets. So Kṛṣṇa says that as soon as one gets this body – it doesn’t matter if it is from India or the moon or the sun or Brahmaloka or anywhere within this material world – one should know that it is due to his sinful activities. There are degrees of sinful activities, so according to the degree of sinfulness, one takes a material body. Therefore our real problem is not how to eat, sleep, mate, and defend – our real problem is how to get a body that is not material but spiritual. That is the ultimate solution to all problems. So Kṛṣṇa guarantees that if one surrenders unto Him, if one becomes fully Kṛṣṇa conscious, then He will give one protection from all reactions to sinful life.32:T567,This assurance was given by Kṛṣṇa in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā,\u003c/em\u003e but there were many fools who could not understand Kṛṣṇa. In the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e they are described as \u003cem\u003emūḍhas. Mūḍha\u003c/em\u003e means “rascal,” and Kṛṣṇa says in the \u003cem\u003eGītā,\u003c/em\u003e “They do"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1," not know what I actually am.” So many people misunderstood Kṛṣṇa. Although Kṛṣṇa gave us this message of the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e so that we could understand Him, many people missed the opportunity. Therefore Kṛṣṇa, out of His compassion, came again, as a devotee, and showed us how to surrender unto Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa Himself came to teach us how to surrender. His last instruction in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e is to surrender, but people – \u003cem\u003emūḍhas,\u003c/em\u003e rascals – said, “Why should I surrender?” Therefore, although Caitanya Mahāprabhu is Kṛṣṇa Himself, this time He teaches us practically how to execute the mission of the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā.\u003c/em\u003e That’s all. Caitanya Mahāprabhu is teaching nothing extraordinary, nothing beyond the process of surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which was already taught in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā.\u003c/em\u003e There is no other teaching, but the same teaching is presented in different ways so that different kinds of people may take it and take the opportunity to approach God.33:T5a1,This human life is meant for advancing on the path of liberation. That is called \u003cem\u003eapavarga,\u003c/em\u003e freedom from entanglement. We are all entangled. Our acceptance of this material body means that we are already entangled. But we should not progress in the process of entanglement. That process is called karma. As long as the mind is absorbed in karma, we will have to accept a material body. At the time of death, our mind may be thinking, “Oh, I could not complete this work. Oh, I am dying! I have to do this. I have to do that.” This means that Kṛṣṇa will give us another chance to do it, and so we will have to accept another body. He will give us the chance: “All right. You could not do it. \u003cem\u003eNow\u003c/em\u003e do it. Take this body.” Therefore the \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e says, “These rascals have become madly intoxicated; because of intoxication they are doing something they should not have done.” What are they doing? Mah"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"ārāja Dhṛtarāṣṭra is a very good example. Mahārāja Dhṛtarāṣṭra was cunningly planning to kill the Pāṇḍavas in order to favor his own sons, so Kṛṣṇa sent His uncle, Akrūra, to advise him not to do that. Dhṛtarāṣṭra understood Akrūra’s instructions, but he said, “My dear Akrūra, what you are saying is quite right, but it does not stand in my heart, so I cannot change my policy. I have to follow this policy and let whatever happens take place.”34:T654,When this body is finished there is no guarantee what kind of body one will take next. Suppose in my next life I by chance get the body of a tree. For thousands of years I will have to stand up. But people are not very serious. They even say, “What is that? Even if I have to stand up, I shall forget.” The lower species of life are situated in forgetfulness. If a tree were not forgetful it would be impossible for it to live. Suppose we were told, “You stand up for three days here!” Because we are not forgetful, we would become mad. So, by nature’s law, all these lower species of life are forgetful. Their consciousness is not developed. A tree has life, but even if someone cuts it, because its consciousness is not developed, it does not respond. So we should be very careful to utilize this human form of life properly. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant for achieving perfection in life. It is not a bluff or exploitation, but unfortunately people are accustomed to being bluffed. There is a verse by an Indian poet: “If one speaks nice things, people will quarrel with him: ’Oh, what nonsense you are speaking.’ But if he bluffs them and cheats them, they will be very glad.” So if a bluffer says, “Just do this, give me my fee, and within six months you will become God,” then they will agree: “Yes, take this fee, and I shall become God within six months.” No. These cheating processes will not solve our problem. If one actually wants to solve the problems of life in this age, then he has to take t"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"o this process of \u003cem\u003ekīrtana.\u003c/em\u003e That is the recommended process.35:T4bb,In all Vedic literature it is confirmed that one must meditate on the Supreme Absolute Truth, Viṣṇu, not on anything else. But there are different processes of meditation recommended for different ages. The process of mystic yogic meditation was possible in Satya-yuga, when men lived for many thousands of years. Now people will not believe this, but in a previous age there were people who lived for one hundred thousand years. That age was called Satya-yuga, and the meditation of mystic yoga was possible at that time. In that age the great yogi Vālmīki Muni meditated for sixty thousand years. So that is a long-term process, which is not possible to execute in this age. If one wishes to conduct a farce, that is another matter. But if one actually wants to practice such meditation, it takes an extremely long time to perfect. In the next age, Tretā-yuga, the process of realization was to perform the various ritualistic sacrifices recommended in the \u003cem\u003eVedas.\u003c/em\u003e In the next age, Dvāpara-yuga, the process was temple worship. In this present age the same result can be achieved by the process of \u003cem\u003ehari-kīrtana,\u003c/em\u003e glorification of Hari, Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.36:T537,So this process of \u003cem\u003ehari-kīrtana\u003c/em\u003e is very simple: Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. Actually there are only three words: \u003cem\u003eHare, Kṛṣṇa,\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eRāma.\u003c/em\u003e But they are very nicely arranged for chanting so that everyone can take the mantra and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare. Since we have started this movement in the Western countries, Europeans, Americans, Africans, Egyptians, and Japanese are all chanting. There is no difficulty. They are chanting very gladly, and they are getting the results. What is the difficulty? We are distributing this chanting free of charge, and it is very simple. S"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"imply by chanting, one can have self-realization, God realization, and when there is God realization, then nature realization is included also. For example, if one learns one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and zero, then he has studied the entirety of mathematics, because mathematics means simply changing the places of these ten figures. That’s all. Similarly, if one simply studies Kṛṣṇa, then all his knowledge is perfect. And Kṛṣṇa is easily understood simply by chanting this \u003cem\u003emantra,\u003c/em\u003e Hare Kṛṣṇa. So why not take this opportunity?37:T504,Take this opportunity that is being offered to human society. It is very ancient and scientific. It is not that it is a concoction that will last for only three or four years. No. In the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e Kṛṣṇa Himself says, “This philosophy is inexhaustible and indestructible. It is never lost or destroyed.” It may be covered for the time being, but it is never destroyed. Therefore it is called \u003cem\u003eavyayam. Vyaya\u003c/em\u003e means “exhaustion.” For example, one may have a hundred dollars, and if they are spent one after another, the next day it will come to zero. That is \u003cem\u003evyaya,\u003c/em\u003e exhaustible. But Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not like that. If you cultivate this knowledge of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then it will increase. That is certified by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. \u003cem\u003eĀnandāmbudhi-vardhanam. Ānanda\u003c/em\u003e means “pleasure,” “transcendental bliss,” and \u003cem\u003eambudhi\u003c/em\u003e means “ocean.” In the material world we see that the ocean does not increase. But if one cultivates Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then his transcendental bliss will simply increase. \u003cem\u003eĀnandāmbudhi-vardhanam.\u003c/em\u003e And I shall always remind everyone that the process is very simple. Anyone can chant, anywhere, without taxation or loss, but the gain is very great.38:T4b5,Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has explained this \u003cem\u003ekīrtana\u003c/em\u003e movement in His \u003cem\u003eŚikṣāṣṭaka.

The Lord says, \u003cem\u003eceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam:\u003c/em\u003e one should cleanse the heart. I have explained this several times, but it does not become monotonous. It is just like the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa; it does not become tiresome. Our students can chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra twenty-four hours a day, and they will never get tired. They will continue to dance and chant. And anyone can try it; because it is not material, one will never get tired of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. In the material world, if one chants anything, any favorite name, for three, four, or ten times, he will get tired of it. That is a fact. But because Hare Kṛṣṇa is not material, if one chants this mantra, he will never get tired. The more one chants, the more his heart will be cleansed of material dirt and the more the problems of his life within this material world will be solved.39:T51f,What is the problem of our lives? That we do not know. Modern education never gives enlightenment about the real problem of life. That is indicated in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā.\u003c/em\u003e Those who are educated and are advancing in knowledge should know what is the problem of life. This problem is stated in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā:\u003c/em\u003e one should always see the inconveniences of birth, death, old age, and disease. Unfortunately no one pays attention to these problems. When a man is diseased he thinks, “All right. Let me go to the doctor. He will give me some medicine, and I will be cured.” But he does not consider the problem very seriously. “I did not want this disease. Why is there disease? Is it not possible to become free from disease?” He never thinks that way. This is because his intelligence is very low-grade, just like that of an animal. An animal suffers, but it has no sense. If an animal is brought to a slaughterhouse and sees that the animal before him is being slaughtered"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,", he will still stand there contentedly eating the grass. This is animal life. He does not know that next time it will be his turn and he will be slaughtered. I have seen it. In a Kālī temple I have seen that a goat was standing there ready to be sacrificed and another goat was very happily eating the grass.3a:T479,A person with this realization has no duty to perform. Because we are now identifying our existence with this material world, we have so many duties. The \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e says that as long as there is no self-realization, we have so many duties and debts. We are indebted to the demigods. The demigods are not merely fictitious. They are real. There are demigods controlling the sun, the moon, and the air. Just as there are directors of government departments, so for the heating department there is the sun-god, for the air department there is Vāyu, and similarly there are other departmental demigods. In the \u003cem\u003eVedas\u003c/em\u003e they are described as controlling deities, so we cannot neglect them. Also, there are great sages and philosophers who have given us knowledge, and we are indebted to them. So as soon as we take birth we are indebted to so many living entities, but it is impossible to liquidate all these debts. Therefore the Vedic literature recommends that one take shelter of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. And Kṛṣṇa says, “If one takes shelter of Me, then he doesn’t have to take shelter of anyone else.”3b:T446,Therefore those who are Kṛṣṇa conscious devotees have taken shelter of Kṛṣṇa, and the beginning is hearing and chanting. \u003cem\u003eŚravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ.\u003c/em\u003e So our fervent, humble request to everyone is to please accept this chanting. This movement of Kṛṣṇa consciousness was introduced by Lord Caitanya five hundred years ago in Bengal, and now all over India and especially in Bengal there are millions of followers of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Now this movement is starting in the Western countries, so just be very serious in understanding it. W"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"e do not criticize any other religion. Don’t take it in that way. We have no business criticizing any other process of religion. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is giving people the most sublime religion – love of God. That’s all. We are teaching to love God. Everyone is already loving, but that love is misplaced. We love this boy or this girl or this country or that society or even the cats and dogs, but we are not satisfied. So we must place our love in God. If one places one’s love in God, he will be happy.3c:T4c0,The transcendental vibration established by the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare is the sublime method for reviving our transcendental consciousness. As living spiritual souls, we are all originally Kṛṣṇa conscious entities, but due to our association with matter from time immemorial, our consciousness is now adulterated by the material atmosphere. The material atmosphere, in which we are now living, is called \u003cem\u003emāyā,\u003c/em\u003e or illusion. \u003cem\u003eMāyā\u003c/em\u003e means “that which is not.” And what is this illusion? The illusion is that we are all trying to be lords of material nature, while actually we are under the grip of her stringent laws. When a servant artificially tries to imitate the all-powerful master, he is said to be in illusion. We are trying to exploit the resources of material nature, but actually we are becoming more and more entangled in her complexities. Therefore, although we are engaged in a hard struggle to conquer nature, we are ever more dependent on her. This illusory struggle against material nature can be stopped at once by revival of our eternal Kṛṣṇa consciousness.3d:T6d3,Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not an artificial imposition on the mind. This consciousness is the original, natural energy of the living entity. When we hear this transcendental vibration, this consciousness is revived. This simplest method of meditation is recommended for this age. By practical ex"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"perience also, one can perceive that by chanting this \u003cem\u003emahā-mantra,\u003c/em\u003e or the great chanting for deliverance, one can at once feel a transcendental ecstasy coming through from the spiritual stratum. In the material concept of life we are busy in the matter of sense gratification, as if we were in the lower, animal stage. A little elevated from this status of sense gratification, one is engaged in mental speculation for the purpose of getting out of the material clutches. A little elevated from this speculative status, when one is intelligent enough, one tries to find out the supreme cause of all causes – within and without. And when one is factually on the plane of spiritual understanding, surpassing the stages of sense, mind, and intelligence, he is then on the transcendental plane. This chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra is enacted from the spiritual platform, and thus this sound vibration surpasses all lower strata of consciousness – namely sensual, mental, and intellectual. There is no need, therefore, to understand the language of the mantra, nor is there any need for mental speculation nor any intellectual adjustment for chanting this \u003cem\u003emahā-mantra.\u003c/em\u003e It is automatic, from the spiritual platform, and as such, anyone can take part in the chanting without any previous qualification. In a more advanced stage, of course, one is not expected to commit offenses on the grounds of spiritual understanding.3e:T49b,In the beginning, there may not be the presence of all transcendental ecstasies, which are eight in number. These are: (1) being stopped as though dumb, (2) perspiration, (3) standing up of hairs on the body, (4) dislocation of voice, (5) trembling, (6) fading of the body, (7) crying in ecstasy, and (8) trance. But there is no doubt that chanting for a while takes one immediately to the spiritual platform, and one shows the first symptom of this in the urge to dance along with the chanting of the mantra. We have seen this practically. Even a child can take part in the chanting and dan"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"cing. Of course, for one who is too entangled in material life, it takes a little more time to come to the standard point, but even such a materially engrossed man is raised to the spiritual platform very quickly. When the mantra is chanted by a pure devotee of the Lord in love, it has the greatest efficacy on hearers, and as such this chanting should be heard from the lips of a pure devotee of the Lord, so that immediate effects can be achieved. As far as possible, chanting from the lips of nondevotees should be avoided. Milk touched by the lips of a serpent has poisonous effects.3f:T4e7,All glories to the \u003cem\u003esaṅkīrtana\u003c/em\u003e movement. \u003cem\u003eParaṁ vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam.\u003c/em\u003e Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, when He was only a sixteen-year-old boy, introduced this \u003cem\u003esaṅkīrtana\u003c/em\u003e movement five hundred years ago in Navadvīpa, India. It was not that He manufactured some religious system, just as nowadays so many religious systems are being manufactured. Actually, religion cannot be manufactured. \u003cem\u003eDharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam.\u003c/em\u003e Religion means the codes of God, the laws of God, that’s all. Certainly we cannot live without obeying the state laws, and similarly we cannot live without obeying the laws of God. And in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e [4.7] the Lord says that whenever there are discrepancies in the prosecution of religious activities (\u003cem\u003eyadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata\u003c/em\u003e) and there is a predominance of irreligious activities (\u003cem\u003eabhyutthānam adharmasya\u003c/em\u003e), at that time I [Kṛṣṇa] appear (\u003cem\u003etadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham\u003c/em\u003e). And in the material world we can see the same principle demonstrated, for whenever there is disobedience of state laws, there is the advent of some particular state officer or policeman to “set things right.”40:T62f,So by the grace of Lord Caitanya, this movement is already introduced in the Western countries, beginning from New York. Our \u003cem\u003esaṅkīrtana\u003c/em\u003e movement was first introduced in New York"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1," in 1966. At that time I came and began to chant this Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra in Tompkins Square. I was chanting there for three hours with a small \u003cem\u003emṛdaṅga\u003c/em\u003e [drum], and these American boys assembled and gradually joined, and so it is increasing. First of all it was started in a New York storefront, 26 Second Avenue, then we started our branches in San Francisco, Montreal, Boston, Los Angeles, Buffalo, Columbus. We now [1970] have twenty-four branches, including one in London and one in Hamburg. In London they are all American boys and girls, and they are preaching. They are not \u003cem\u003esannyāsīs,\u003c/em\u003e nor are they Vedāntists, nor Hindus, nor Indians, but they have taken this movement very seriously. Even in the London \u003cem\u003eTimes\u003c/em\u003e there was an article headlined, “Kṛṣṇa Chant Startles London.” So we have many in the movement now. All my disciples, at least in this country, are Americans and Europeans. They are chanting, dancing, and distributing a magazine, \u003cem\u003eBack to Godhead.\u003c/em\u003e Now we have published many books – the \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Bhagavad-gītā As It Is, Teachings of Lord Caitanya,\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eĪśopaniṣad.\u003c/em\u003e It is not that this movement is simply a sentimental movement. Don’t think that these boys are dancing out of some religious sentiment or fanaticism. No. We have the highest philosophical and theosophical background.41:T7fe,When the Vedānta philosophy was thoroughly discussed between Lord Caitanya and Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī first of all asked Caitanya Mahāprabhu, “I understand that You were a very good scholar in Your early life. [Lord Caitanya was actually a very great scholar. His name was Nimāi Paṇḍita, and at the age of sixteen He defeated a great scholar from Kashmir, Keśava Kāśmīrī.] And I understand that You are a great Sanskrit scholar, and that especially in logic You are a very learned scholar. You were also born in a \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa\u003c/em\u003e family, and now You are a \u003cem\u003esannyāsī.\u003c/em\u003e How is it that You"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1," are chanting and dancing and not reading the Vedānta?” This was the first question asked by Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, and Lord Caitanya replied, “Yes, the reason is that when I was initiated by My spiritual master, he said that I am fool number one. ’You don’t discuss the Vedānta,’ he told Me. ’You will simply spoil Your time. Just take to this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, and You will be successful.’” That was his reply. Of course, Caitanya Mahāprabhu was not a fool, and certainly the Vedānta is not for fools. One needs sufficient education, and one must attain a certain status before he can understand the Vedānta. In each and every word there are volumes of meanings, and there are many commentaries by Śaṅkarācārya and Rāmānujācārya, huge volumes in Sanskrit. But how can we understand Vedānta? It is not possible. It \u003cem\u003emay\u003c/em\u003e be possible for one person or two persons to understand, but for the mass of people it is not possible. Nor is it possible to practice yoga. Therefore, if one takes to Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s method, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, the first installment of gain will be \u003cem\u003eceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam:\u003c/em\u003e all the dirty things will be cleansed from the heart simply by chanting. Chant. There is no expenditure and there is no loss. If one simply chants for one week, he will see how much he will progress in spiritual knowledge.42:T41c,To work very hard and satisfy oneself by sense gratification is the business of hogs, not human beings.

We have already started New Jagannātha Purī in San Francisco, and the Ratha-yātrā festival is going on. This year there will be a great ceremony of Ratha-yātrā in London also. There will be three cars, for Jagannātha, Subhadrā, and Balarāma, and they will be taken to the river Thames. And America has imported New England and New York, so why not New Vrindavan? We should especially establish this New Vrindavan, because Lord Caitanya recommended, \u003cem\u003eārādhyo bhagavān vrajeśa-tanayas tad-dhāma vṛndāvanam:\u003c/em\u003e “Kṛṣṇa, the son of Nanda Mahārāja in Vṛndāvana-dhāma, or Vraja-bhūmi, is the supreme worshipable Deity, and His place Vṛndāvana is also worshipable.” The Western boys and girls are taking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and they should have a place like Vṛndāvana. Swami Kīrtanānanda, who went to Vṛndāvana with me two years ago, knows what Vṛndāvana is like, so I have instructed him to construct at least seven temples. In Vṛndāvana, there are five thousand temples of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, but the most important temples are seven, established by the Gosvāmīs. Our program is to live in New Vrindavan, depend on agriculture and cows as an economic solution, and peacefully execute Kṛṣṇa consciousness, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa – that is the Vṛndāvana scheme. \u003cem\u003eYuktāhāra-vihārasya … yogo bhavati duḥkha-hā\u003c/em\u003e [\u003ca href=\"/en/library/bg/6/17/"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e 6.17\u003c/a\u003e]. This human form of life isn’t meant for increasing artificial needs. We should be satisfied just to maintain the body and soul together, and the rest of the time we should enhance our Kṛṣṇa consciousness, so that after leaving this body we won’t have to take another material body, but will be able to go back home, back to Godhead. That should be the motto of human life.44:T4c0,Material life means eating, sleeping, mating, and defending, and spiritual life means something more than this. This is also the difference between animal life and human life. In animal life, the common formula is eating, sleeping, mating, and defending. A dog eats, a man also eats. A man sleeps, and a dog also sleeps. A man has sex, and the dog also has sex. The dog defends in his own way, and man also defends in his own way, maybe by atomic bombs. These four principles are common to human beings and animals, and advancement of these four principles is not human civilization but animal civilization. Human civilization means \u003cem\u003eathāto brahma-jijñāsā.\u003c/em\u003e In the \u003cem\u003eVedānta-sūtra\u003c/em\u003e the first aphorism is \u003cem\u003eathāto brahma-jijñāsā:\u003c/em\u003e “Now is the time for inquiry about Brahman.” That is human life.

He must be inquisitive to know what he is and why he is put into these miseries of birth, death, old age, and disease. Is there any remedy? These matters should be questioned. That is human life; that is spiritual life.45:T503,\u003cstrong\u003eŚrīla Prabhupāda: \u003c/strong\u003eYes. Both the fire and the spark are fire, but one is big and the other is very small. Unlike the relationship between the spark and the fire, however, our relationship with God is eternal, although at the present moment we have forgotten that relationship due to contact with the material energy. We are facing so many problems only because of this forgetfu"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"lness. If we can revive our original God consciousness, then we shall become happy. This is the sum and substance of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is the best process by which to revive our original God consciousness. There are different processes of self-realization, but in the present age of Kali, people are very fallen, and they require the simple process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Now they are thinking that so-called material advancement is the solution to their problems, but this is not a fact. The real solution is to get out of the material condition entirely by becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious. Because God is eternal, we are also eternal, but in the material condition we are thinking, “I am this body,” and therefore we must repeatedly change from body to body. This is due to ignorance. Actually we are not our bodies but spiritual sparks, parts and parcels of God.46:T422,To stop the repetition of birth and death in different forms of life, we must transcend the covering of material nature and come to the platform of pure consciousness. But if we do not learn the transcendental science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then at death we must transfer to another body, either better or worse than our present one. If we cultivate the mode of goodness, then we are promoted to the higher planetary system, where there is a better standard of life. If we cultivate the mode of passion, then we will remain at the present stage. But if out of ignorance we commit sinful activities and violate nature’s laws, then we will be degraded to animal or plant life. Then again we must evolve to the human form, a process that may take millions of years. Therefore a human being must be responsible. He must take advantage of the rare opportunity of human life by understanding his relationship with God and acting accordingly. Then he can get out of the cycle of birth and death in different forms of life and go back home, back to Godhead.49:T5a2,Therefore, in the \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e it is said that this is the incarnation"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1," of God in this age. And who worships Him? The process is very simple. Just keep a picture of Lord Caitanya with His associates. Lord Caitanya is in the middle, accompanied by His principal associates – Nityānanda, Advaita, Gadādhara, and Śrīvāsa. One simply has to keep this picture. One can keep it anywhere. It is not that one has to come to us to see this picture. Anyone can have this picture in his home, chant this Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, and thus worship Lord Caitanya. That is the simple method. But who will capture this simple method? Those who have good brains. Without much bother, if one simply keeps a picture of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu at home and chants Hare Kṛṣṇa, then one will realize God. Anyone can adopt this simple method. There is no expenditure, there is no tax, nor is there any need to build a very big church or temple. Anyone, anywhere, can sit down on the road or beneath a tree and chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra and worship God. Therefore it is a great opportunity. For example, in business or political life one sometimes finds a great opportunity. Those who are intelligent politicians take a good opportunity and make a success of it the first time it comes. Similarly, in this age, those who have sufficient intelligence take to this \u003cem\u003esaṅkīrtana\u003c/em\u003e movement, and they advance very quickly.4a:T451,We have to take Kṛṣṇa’s word as it is. For example, we teach small children that beyond England there are other places, called Germany, India, etc., and the child has to learn about these places from the version of the teacher because they are beyond his sphere. Similarly, beyond this material sky there is another sky. One cannot experiment to find it, any more than a small child can experiment to find Germany or India. That is not possible. If we want to get knowledge, then we have to accept authority. Similarly, if we want to know what is beyond the material world, then we have to accept the Vedic authority. Otherwise there is no possibility of knowing. It is beyond "])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"material knowledge. One cannot go to the far planets in this universe, what to speak of going beyond this universe. The estimation is that in order to go to the highest planet of this universe with modern machinery one would have to travel for forty thousand years. So we cannot even travel within this material sky. Our lifetime and means are so limited that we cannot have proper knowledge of even this material world.4b:T512,In the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā,\u003c/em\u003e when Arjuna asked Kṛṣṇa, “Will You kindly explain the extent to which Your energies are working?” the Supreme Lord gave him so many instances, and at the end He finally said, “My dear Arjuna, what shall I explain about My energies? It is not actually possible for you to understand. But you can just imagine the expansion of My energies: this material world, which consists of millions of universes, is a display of only one fourth of My creation.” We cannot estimate the position of even one universe, and there are millions of universes. Then beyond that is the spiritual sky, and there are millions of spiritual planets. All this information is available from the Vedic literature. If one accepts Vedic literature, then he can get this knowledge. If one doesn’t accept it, there is no other means. That is our choice. Therefore, according to Vedic civilization, whenever an \u003cem\u003eācārya\u003c/em\u003e speaks he immediately gives references from the Vedic literature. Then others will accept it: “Yes, it is correct.” In a law court the lawyer gives references from past judgments of the court, and if his case is tight, the judge accepts. Similarly, if one can give evidence from the \u003cem\u003eVedas,\u003c/em\u003e then it is understood that his position is factual.4c:T4bd,If a person engaged in yoga, the process of self-realization, somehow or other fails to complete the process, he is given another chance; he is given birth in a family of a pure \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa\u003c/em\u003e or a rich man. If one is fortunate enough to take birth in such a family, he gets all facilities to understand the "])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"importance of self-realization. From the very beginning of life our Kṛṣṇa conscious children are getting the opportunity to learn how to chant and dance, so when they are grown up they will not change, but instead will automatically make progress. They are very fortunate. Regardless of whether he is born in America or Europe, a child will advance if his father and mother are devotees. He gets this opportunity. If a child takes birth in a family of devotees, this means that in his last life he had already taken to the yoga process, but somehow or other he could not finish it. Therefore the child is given another opportunity to make progress under the care of a good father and mother so that he will again advance. In this way, as soon as one completes his development of God consciousness, then he no longer has to take birth in this material world, but returns to the spiritual world.4d:T4e1,Kṛṣṇa says in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā:\u003c/em\u003e “My dear Arjuna, if one understands My appearance, disappearance, and activities, simply because of this understanding he is given the opportunity to take birth in the spiritual world after giving up this body.” One has to give up this body – today, tomorrow, or maybe the day after that. One has to. But a person who has understood Kṛṣṇa will not have to take another material body. He goes directly to the spiritual world and takes birth in one of the spiritual planets. So Kṛṣṇa says that as soon as one gets this body – it doesn’t matter if it is from India or the moon or the sun or Brahmaloka or anywhere within this material world – one should know that it is due to his sinful activities. There are degrees of sinful activities, so according to the degree of sinfulness, one takes a material body. Therefore our real problem is not how to eat, sleep, mate, and defend – our real problem is how to get a body that is not material but spiritual. That is the ultimate solution to all problems. So Kṛṣṇa guarantees that if one surrenders unto Him, if "])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"one becomes fully Kṛṣṇa conscious, then He will give one protection from all reactions to sinful life.4e:T567,This assurance was given by Kṛṣṇa in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā,\u003c/em\u003e but there were many fools who could not understand Kṛṣṇa. In the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e they are described as \u003cem\u003emūḍhas. Mūḍha\u003c/em\u003e means “rascal,” and Kṛṣṇa says in the \u003cem\u003eGītā,\u003c/em\u003e “They do not know what I actually am.” So many people misunderstood Kṛṣṇa. Although Kṛṣṇa gave us this message of the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e so that we could understand Him, many people missed the opportunity. Therefore Kṛṣṇa, out of His compassion, came again, as a devotee, and showed us how to surrender unto Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa Himself came to teach us how to surrender. His last instruction in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e is to surrender, but people – \u003cem\u003emūḍhas,\u003c/em\u003e rascals – said, “Why should I surrender?” Therefore, although Caitanya Mahāprabhu is Kṛṣṇa Himself, this time He teaches us practically how to execute the mission of the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā.\u003c/em\u003e That’s all. Caitanya Mahāprabhu is teaching nothing extraordinary, nothing beyond the process of surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which was already taught in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā.\u003c/em\u003e There is no other teaching, but the same teaching is presented in different ways so that different kinds of people may take it and take the opportunity to approach God.4f:T5a1,This human life is meant for advancing on the path of liberation. That is called \u003cem\u003eapavarga,\u003c/em\u003e freedom from entanglement. We are all entangled. Our acceptance of this material body means that we are already entangled. But we should not progress in the process of entanglement. That process is called karma. As long as the mind is absorbed in karma, we will have to accept a material body. At the time of death, our mind may be thinking, “Oh, I could not complete this work. Oh, I am dying! I have to do this. I have to do that.” Thi"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"s means that Kṛṣṇa will give us another chance to do it, and so we will have to accept another body. He will give us the chance: “All right. You could not do it. \u003cem\u003eNow\u003c/em\u003e do it. Take this body.” Therefore the \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e says, “These rascals have become madly intoxicated; because of intoxication they are doing something they should not have done.” What are they doing? Mahārāja Dhṛtarāṣṭra is a very good example. Mahārāja Dhṛtarāṣṭra was cunningly planning to kill the Pāṇḍavas in order to favor his own sons, so Kṛṣṇa sent His uncle, Akrūra, to advise him not to do that. Dhṛtarāṣṭra understood Akrūra’s instructions, but he said, “My dear Akrūra, what you are saying is quite right, but it does not stand in my heart, so I cannot change my policy. I have to follow this policy and let whatever happens take place.”50:T654,When this body is finished there is no guarantee what kind of body one will take next. Suppose in my next life I by chance get the body of a tree. For thousands of years I will have to stand up. But people are not very serious. They even say, “What is that? Even if I have to stand up, I shall forget.” The lower species of life are situated in forgetfulness. If a tree were not forgetful it would be impossible for it to live. Suppose we were told, “You stand up for three days here!” Because we are not forgetful, we would become mad. So, by nature’s law, all these lower species of life are forgetful. Their consciousness is not developed. A tree has life, but even if someone cuts it, because its consciousness is not developed, it does not respond. So we should be very careful to utilize this human form of life properly. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant for achieving perfection in life. It is not a bluff or exploitation, but unfortunately people are accustomed to being bluffed. There is a verse by an Indian poet: “If one speaks nice things, people will quarrel with him: ’Oh, what nonsense you are sp"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"eaking.’ But if he bluffs them and cheats them, they will be very glad.” So if a bluffer says, “Just do this, give me my fee, and within six months you will become God,” then they will agree: “Yes, take this fee, and I shall become God within six months.” No. These cheating processes will not solve our problem. If one actually wants to solve the problems of life in this age, then he has to take to this process of \u003cem\u003ekīrtana.\u003c/em\u003e That is the recommended process.51:T4bb,In all Vedic literature it is confirmed that one must meditate on the Supreme Absolute Truth, Viṣṇu, not on anything else. But there are different processes of meditation recommended for different ages. The process of mystic yogic meditation was possible in Satya-yuga, when men lived for many thousands of years. Now people will not believe this, but in a previous age there were people who lived for one hundred thousand years. That age was called Satya-yuga, and the meditation of mystic yoga was possible at that time. In that age the great yogi Vālmīki Muni meditated for sixty thousand years. So that is a long-term process, which is not possible to execute in this age. If one wishes to conduct a farce, that is another matter. But if one actually wants to practice such meditation, it takes an extremely long time to perfect. In the next age, Tretā-yuga, the process of realization was to perform the various ritualistic sacrifices recommended in the \u003cem\u003eVedas.\u003c/em\u003e In the next age, Dvāpara-yuga, the process was temple worship. In this present age the same result can be achieved by the process of \u003cem\u003ehari-kīrtana,\u003c/em\u003e glorification of Hari, Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.52:T537,So this process of \u003cem\u003ehari-kīrtana\u003c/em\u003e is very simple: Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. Actually there are only three words: \u003cem\u003eHare, Kṛṣṇa,\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eRāma.\u003c/em\u003e But they are very nicely arranged for chanting so that everyone can take the m"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"antra and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare. Since we have started this movement in the Western countries, Europeans, Americans, Africans, Egyptians, and Japanese are all chanting. There is no difficulty. They are chanting very gladly, and they are getting the results. What is the difficulty? We are distributing this chanting free of charge, and it is very simple. Simply by chanting, one can have self-realization, God realization, and when there is God realization, then nature realization is included also. For example, if one learns one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and zero, then he has studied the entirety of mathematics, because mathematics means simply changing the places of these ten figures. That’s all. Similarly, if one simply studies Kṛṣṇa, then all his knowledge is perfect. And Kṛṣṇa is easily understood simply by chanting this \u003cem\u003emantra,\u003c/em\u003e Hare Kṛṣṇa. So why not take this opportunity?53:T504,Take this opportunity that is being offered to human society. It is very ancient and scientific. It is not that it is a concoction that will last for only three or four years. No. In the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e Kṛṣṇa Himself says, “This philosophy is inexhaustible and indestructible. It is never lost or destroyed.” It may be covered for the time being, but it is never destroyed. Therefore it is called \u003cem\u003eavyayam. Vyaya\u003c/em\u003e means “exhaustion.” For example, one may have a hundred dollars, and if they are spent one after another, the next day it will come to zero. That is \u003cem\u003evyaya,\u003c/em\u003e exhaustible. But Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not like that. If you cultivate this knowledge of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then it will increase. That is certified by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. \u003cem\u003eĀnandāmbudhi-vardhanam. Ānanda\u003c/em\u003e means “pleasure,” “transcendental bliss,” and \u003cem\u003eambudhi\u003c/em\u003e means “ocean.” In the material world we see that the ocean does not increase. But if one cultivates Kṛṣṇa consciousness"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,", then his transcendental bliss will simply increase. \u003cem\u003eĀnandāmbudhi-vardhanam.\u003c/em\u003e And I shall always remind everyone that the process is very simple. Anyone can chant, anywhere, without taxation or loss, but the gain is very great.54:T4b5,Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has explained this \u003cem\u003ekīrtana\u003c/em\u003e movement in His \u003cem\u003eŚikṣāṣṭaka. Śikṣā\u003c/em\u003e means “instruction,” and \u003cem\u003eaṣṭaka\u003c/em\u003e means “eight.” He has given us eight verses to help us understand this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, and I shall explain the first of these instructions. The Lord says, \u003cem\u003eceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam:\u003c/em\u003e one should cleanse the heart. I have explained this several times, but it does not become monotonous. It is just like the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa; it does not become tiresome. Our students can chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra twenty-four hours a day, and they will never get tired. They will continue to dance and chant. And anyone can try it; because it is not material, one will never get tired of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. In the material world, if one chants anything, any favorite name, for three, four, or ten times, he will get tired of it. That is a fact. But because Hare Kṛṣṇa is not material, if one chants this mantra, he will never get tired. The more one chants, the more his heart will be cleansed of material dirt and the more the problems of his life within this material world will be solved.55:T51f,What is the problem of our lives? That we do not know. Modern education never gives enlightenment about the real problem of life. That is indicated in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā.\u003c/em\u003e Those who are educated and are advancing in knowledge should know what is the problem of life. This problem is stated in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā:\u003c/em\u003e one should always see the inconveniences of birth, death, old age, and disease. Unfortunately no one pays attention to these problems. When a man is diseased he thinks, “All right. Let me go to the doctor. He will give me some medicine, and I will be cure"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"d.” But he does not consider the problem very seriously. “I did not want this disease. Why is there disease? Is it not possible to become free from disease?” He never thinks that way. This is because his intelligence is very low-grade, just like that of an animal. An animal suffers, but it has no sense. If an animal is brought to a slaughterhouse and sees that the animal before him is being slaughtered, he will still stand there contentedly eating the grass. This is animal life. He does not know that next time it will be his turn and he will be slaughtered. I have seen it. In a Kālī temple I have seen that a goat was standing there ready to be sacrificed and another goat was very happily eating the grass.56:T479,A person with this realization has no duty to perform. Because we are now identifying our existence with this material world, we have so many duties. The \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e says that as long as there is no self-realization, we have so many duties and debts. We are indebted to the demigods. The demigods are not merely fictitious. They are real. There are demigods controlling the sun, the moon, and the air. Just as there are directors of government departments, so for the heating department there is the sun-god, for the air department there is Vāyu, and similarly there are other departmental demigods. In the \u003cem\u003eVedas\u003c/em\u003e they are described as controlling deities, so we cannot neglect them. Also, there are great sages and philosophers who have given us knowledge, and we are indebted to them. So as soon as we take birth we are indebted to so many living entities, but it is impossible to liquidate all these debts. Therefore the Vedic literature recommends that one take shelter of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. And Kṛṣṇa says, “If one takes shelter of Me, then he doesn’t have to take shelter of anyone else.”57:T446,Therefore those who are Kṛṣṇa conscious devotees have taken shelter of Kṛṣṇa, and the beginning is hearing and chanting. \u003cem\u003eŚravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ vi"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"ṣṇoḥ.\u003c/em\u003e So our fervent, humble request to everyone is to please accept this chanting. This movement of Kṛṣṇa consciousness was introduced by Lord Caitanya five hundred years ago in Bengal, and now all over India and especially in Bengal there are millions of followers of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Now this movement is starting in the Western countries, so just be very serious in understanding it. We do not criticize any other religion. Don’t take it in that way. We have no business criticizing any other process of religion. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is giving people the most sublime religion – love of God. That’s all. We are teaching to love God. Everyone is already loving, but that love is misplaced. We love this boy or this girl or this country or that society or even the cats and dogs, but we are not satisfied. So we must place our love in God. If one places one’s love in God, he will be happy.58:T4c0,The transcendental vibration established by the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare is the sublime method for reviving our transcendental consciousness. As living spiritual souls, we are all originally Kṛṣṇa conscious entities, but due to our association with matter from time immemorial, our consciousness is now adulterated by the material atmosphere. The material atmosphere, in which we are now living, is called \u003cem\u003emāyā,\u003c/em\u003e or illusion. \u003cem\u003eMāyā\u003c/em\u003e means “that which is not.” And what is this illusion? The illusion is that we are all trying to be lords of material nature, while actually we are under the grip of her stringent laws. When a servant artificially tries to imitate the all-powerful master, he is said to be in illusion. We are trying to exploit the resources of material nature, but actually we are becoming more and more entangled in her complexities. Therefore, although we are engaged in a hard struggle to conquer nature, we are ever more dependent on her. This illusory str"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"uggle against material nature can be stopped at once by revival of our eternal Kṛṣṇa consciousness.59:T6d3,Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not an artificial imposition on the mind. This consciousness is the original, natural energy of the living entity. When we hear this transcendental vibration, this consciousness is revived. This simplest method of meditation is recommended for this age. By practical experience also, one can perceive that by chanting this \u003cem\u003emahā-mantra,\u003c/em\u003e or the great chanting for deliverance, one can at once feel a transcendental ecstasy coming through from the spiritual stratum. In the material concept of life we are busy in the matter of sense gratification, as if we were in the lower, animal stage. A little elevated from this status of sense gratification, one is engaged in mental speculation for the purpose of getting out of the material clutches. A little elevated from this speculative status, when one is intelligent enough, one tries to find out the supreme cause of all causes – within and without. And when one is factually on the plane of spiritual understanding, surpassing the stages of sense, mind, and intelligence, he is then on the transcendental plane. This chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra is enacted from the spiritual platform, and thus this sound vibration surpasses all lower strata of consciousness – namely sensual, mental, and intellectual. There is no need, therefore, to understand the language of the mantra, nor is there any need for mental speculation nor any intellectual adjustment for chanting this \u003cem\u003emahā-mantra.\u003c/em\u003e It is automatic, from the spiritual platform, and as such, anyone can take part in the chanting without any previous qualification. In a more advanced stage, of course, one is not expected to commit offenses on the grounds of spiritual understanding.5a:T49b,In the beginning, there may not be the presence of all transcendental ecstasies, which are eight in number. These are: (1) being stopped as though dumb, (2) perspiration, (3) stand"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"ing up of hairs on the body, (4) dislocation of voice, (5) trembling, (6) fading of the body, (7) crying in ecstasy, and (8) trance. But there is no doubt that chanting for a while takes one immediately to the spiritual platform, and one shows the first symptom of this in the urge to dance along with the chanting of the mantra. We have seen this practically. Even a child can take part in the chanting and dancing. Of course, for one who is too entangled in material life, it takes a little more time to come to the standard point, but even such a materially engrossed man is raised to the spiritual platform very quickly. When the mantra is chanted by a pure devotee of the Lord in love, it has the greatest efficacy on hearers, and as such this chanting should be heard from the lips of a pure devotee of the Lord, so that immediate effects can be achieved. As far as possible, chanting from the lips of nondevotees should be avoided. Milk touched by the lips of a serpent has poisonous effects.5b:T4e7,All glories to the \u003cem\u003esaṅkīrtana\u003c/em\u003e movement. \u003cem\u003eParaṁ vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam.\u003c/em\u003e Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, when He was only a sixteen-year-old boy, introduced this \u003cem\u003esaṅkīrtana\u003c/em\u003e movement five hundred years ago in Navadvīpa, India. It was not that He manufactured some religious system, just as nowadays so many religious systems are being manufactured. Actually, religion cannot be manufactured. \u003cem\u003eDharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam.\u003c/em\u003e Religion means the codes of God, the laws of God, that’s all.

Our \u003cem\u003esaṅkīrtana\u003c/em\u003e movement was first introduced in New York in 1966. At that time I came and began to chant this Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra in Tompkins Square. I was chanting there for three hours with a small \u003cem\u003emṛdaṅga\u003c/em\u003e [drum], and these American boys assembled and gradually joined, and so it is increasing. First of all it was started in a New York storefront, 26 Second Avenue, then we started our branches in San Francisco, Montreal, Boston, Los Angeles, Buffalo, Columbus. We now [1970] have twenty-four branches, including one in London and one in Hamburg. In London they are all American boys and girls, and they are preaching. They are not \u003cem\u003esannyāsīs,\u003c/em\u003e nor are they Vedāntists, nor Hindus, nor Indians, but they have taken this movement very seriously. Even in the London \u003cem\u003eTimes\u003c/em\u003e there was an article headlined, “Kṛṣṇa Chant Startles London.” So we have many in the movement now. All my disciples, at least in this country, are Americans and Europeans. They are chanting, dancing, and distributing a magazine, \u003cem\u003eBack to Godhead.\u003c/em\u003e Now we have published many books – the \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Bhagavad-gītā As It Is, Teachings of Lord Caitanya,\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eĪśopaniṣad.\u003c/em\u003e It is not that this movement is simply a sentimental movement. Don’t think that these boys are dancing out of some religious sentiment or fanaticism. No. We have the highest philosophical and theosophical background.5d:T7fe,When the Vedānta philosophy was thoroughly discussed between Lord Caitanya and Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī first of all asked Caitanya Mahāprabhu, “I understand that You were a very good scholar in Your e"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"arly life.

His name was Nimāi Paṇḍita, and at the age of sixteen He defeated a great scholar from Kashmir, Keśava Kāśmīrī.] And I understand that You are a great Sanskrit scholar, and that especially in logic You are a very learned scholar. You were also born in a \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa\u003c/em\u003e family, and now You are a \u003cem\u003esannyāsī.\u003c/em\u003e How is it that You are chanting and dancing and not reading the Vedānta?” This was the first question asked by Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, and Lord Caitanya replied, “Yes, the reason is that when I was initiated by My spiritual master, he said that I am fool number one. ’You don’t discuss the Vedānta,’ he told Me. ’You will simply spoil Your time. Just take to this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, and You will be successful.’” That was his reply. Of course, Caitanya Mahāprabhu was not a fool, and certainly the Vedānta is not for fools. One needs sufficient education, and one must attain a certain status before he can understand the Vedānta. In each and every word there are volumes of meanings, and there are many commentaries by Śaṅkarācārya and Rāmānujācārya, huge volumes in Sanskrit. But how can we understand Vedānta? It is not possible. It \u003cem\u003emay\u003c/em\u003e be possible for one person or two persons to understand, but for the mass of people it is not possible. Nor is it possible to practice yoga. Therefore, if one takes to Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s method, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, the first installment of gain will be \u003cem\u003eceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam:\u003c/em\u003e all the dirty things will be cleansed from the heart simply by chanting.

Both the fire and the spark are fire, but one is big and the other is very small. Unlike the relationship between the spark and the fire, however, our relationship with God is eternal, although at the present moment we have forgotten that relationship due to contact with the material energy. We are facing so many problems only because of this forgetfulness. If we can revive our original God consciousness, then we shall become happy. This is the sum and substance of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is the best process by which to revive our original God consciousness. There are different processes of self-realization, but in the present age of Kali, people are very fallen, and they require the simple process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Now they are thinking that so-called material advancement is the solution to their problems, but this is not a fact. The real solution is to get out of the material condition entirely by becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious. Because God is eternal, we are also eternal, but in the material condition we are thinking, “I am this body,” and therefore we must repeatedly change from body to body. This is due to ignorance. Actually we are not our bodies but spiritual sparks, parts and parcels of God.61:T422,To stop the repetition of birth and death in different forms of life, we must transcend the covering of material nature and come to the platform of pure consciousness.

We should especially establish this New Vrindavan, because Lord Caitanya recommended, \",[\"$\",\"em\",\"1\",{\"children\":\"ārādhyo bhagavān vrajeśa-tanayas tad-dhāma vṛndāvanam:\"}],\" “Kṛṣṇa, the son of Nanda Mahārāja in Vṛndāvana-dhāma, or Vraja-bhūmi, is the supreme worshipable Deity, and His place Vṛndāvana is also worshipable.” The Western boys and girls are taking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and they should have a place like Vṛndāvana. Swami Kīrtanānanda, who went to Vṛndāvana with me two years ago, knows what Vṛndāvana is like, so I have instructed him to construct at least seven temples. In Vṛndāvana, there are five thousand temples of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, but the most important temples are seven, established by the Gosvāmīs. Our program is to live in New Vrindavan, depend on agriculture and cows as an economic solution, and peacefully execute Kṛṣṇa consciousness, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa – that is the Vṛndāvana scheme. \",[\"$\",\"em\",\"3\",{\"children\":\"Yuktāhāra-vihārasya … yogo bhavati duḥkha-hā\"}],\" [\",[\"$\",\"$L29\",\"5\",{\"href\":\"/en/library/bg/6/17/\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"em\",\"0\",{\"children\":\"Bhagavad-gītā\"}],\" 6.17\"]}],\"].
