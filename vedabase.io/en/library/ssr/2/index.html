Tamas</em> or <em>timira</em> means “darkness.” This material world is dark, and therefore it needs sunlight or moonlight for illumination. However, there is another world, a spiritual world, that is beyond this darkness.

Therefore due to ignorance there is infection, and we suffer from disease. A criminal may say, “I did not know the law,” but he will not be excused if he commits a crime. Ignorance is no excuse. Similarly, a child, not knowing that fire will burn, will touch the fire. The fire does not think, “This is a child, and he does not know I will burn.” No, there is no excuse. Just as there are state laws, there are also stringent laws of nature, and these laws will act despite our ignorance of them. If we do something wrong out of ignorance, we must suffer. This is the law. Whether the law is a state law or a law of nature, we risk suffering if we break it.</div></div><div id="bb96967" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The guru’s business is to see that no human being suffers in this material world. No one can claim that he is not suffering. That is not possible. In this material world, there are three kinds of suffering: <em>ādhyātmika, ādhibhautika,</em> and <em>ādhidaivika.</em> These are miseries arising from the material body and mind, from other living entities, and from the forces of nature. We may suffer mental anguish, or we may suffer from other living entities – from ants or mosquitoes or flies – or we may suffer due to some superior power. There may be no rain, or there may be flood. There may be excessive heat or excessive cold. So many types of suffering are imposed by nature. Thus there are three types of miseries within the material world, and everyone is suffering from one, two, or three of them. No one can say that he is completely free from suffering.</div></div><div id="bb96968" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">We may then ask <em>why</em> the living entity is suffering. The answer is: out of ignorance. He does not think, “I am committing mistakes and am leading a sinful life; that is why I am suffering.” Therefore the guru’s first business is to rescue his disciple from this ignorance. We send our children to school to save them from suffering. If our children do not receive an education, we fear that they will suffer in the future. The guru sees that suffering is due to ignorance, which is compared to darkness. How can one in darkness be saved? By light. The guru takes the torchlight of knowledge and presents it before the living entity enveloped in darkness. That knowledge relieves him from the sufferings of the darkness of ignorance.</div></div><div id="bb96969" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">One may ask whether the guru is absolutely necessary.

Although hundreds and thousands of <em>ācāryas</em> have come and gone, the message is one. The real guru cannot be two, for the real guru does not speak differently from his predecessors. Some spiritual teachers say, “In my opinion you should do this,” but this is not a guru. Such so-called gurus are simply rascals. The genuine guru has only one opinion, and that is the opinion expressed by Kṛṣṇa, Vyāsadeva, Nārada, Arjuna, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and the Six Gosvāmīs. Five thousand years ago Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa spoke the <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> and Vyāsadeva recorded it. Śrīla Vyāsadeva did not say, “This is my opinion.” Rather, he wrote, <em>śrī-bhagavān uvāca,</em> that is, “The Supreme Personality of Godhead says.” Whatever Vyāsadeva wrote was originally spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

He does not misinterpret the words of Kṛṣṇa, but transmits them exactly as they were spoken. If we send a telegram, the person who delivers the telegram does not have to correct it, edit it, or add to it. He simply presents it. That is the guru’s business.

The Six Gosvāmīs also transmitted the same message, and we are simply following in their footsteps. There is no difference. We do not interpret the words of Kṛṣṇa by saying, “In my opinion, the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra represents the human body.” Such interpretations are set forth by rascals. In the world there are many rascal gurus who give their own opinion, but we can challenge any rascal. A rascal guru may say, “I am God,” or, “We are all God.” That is all right, but we should find out from the dictionary what the meaning of <em>God</em> is. Generally, a dictionary will tell us that the word <em>God</em> indicates the Supreme Being. Thus we may ask such a guru, “Are you the Supreme Being?” If he cannot understand this, then we should give the meaning of <em>supreme.</em> Any dictionary will inform us that <em>supreme</em> means “the greatest authority.” We may then ask, “Are you the greatest authority?” Such a rascal guru, even though proclaiming himself to be God, cannot answer such a question. God is the Supreme Being and the highest authority. No one is equal to Him or greater than Him. Yet there are many guru-gods, many rascals who claim to be the Supreme. Such rascals cannot help us escape the darkness of material existence. They cannot illumine our darkness with the torchlight of spiritual knowledge.</div></div><div id="bb96977" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The bona fide guru will simply present what the supreme guru, God, says in bona fide scripture.

Surrender must be there, for without surrender we cannot learn anything. If we go to a guru simply to challenge him, we will learn nothing.

The guru is Kṛṣṇa’s representative, the former <em>ācāryas’</em> representative. Kṛṣṇa says that all <em>ācāryas</em> are His representatives; therefore the guru should be offered the same respect one would offer to God. As Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura says in his prayers to the spiritual master, <em>yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādaḥ:</em> “By the mercy of the spiritual master, one receives the benediction of Kṛṣṇa.” Thus, if we surrender to the bona fide guru, we surrender to God.

Therefore it is said, <em>sākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstraiḥ:</em> the guru is as good as God. When we offer respects to the guru, we are offering respects to God. Because we are trying to be God conscious, it is required that we learn how to offer respects to God through God’s representative. In all the <em>śāstras</em> the guru is described to be as good as God, but the guru never says, “I am God.” The disciple’s duty is to offer respect to the guru just as he offers respect to God, but the guru never thinks, “My disciples are offering me the same respect they offer to God; therefore I have become God.” As soon as he thinks like this, he becomes a dog instead of God. Therefore Viśvanātha Cakravartī says, <em>kintu prabhor yaḥ priya eva tasya.</em> Because he is the most confidential servitor of God, the guru is offered the same respect that we offer God. God is always God, guru is always guru. As a matter of etiquette, God is the worshipable God, and guru is the worshiper God (<em>sevaka-bhagavān</em>). Therefore the guru is addressed as <em>prabhupāda.</em> The word <em>prabhu</em> means “lord,” and <em>pāda</em> means “position.” Thus <em>prabhupāda</em> means “he who has taken the position of the Lord.” This is the same as <em>sākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstraiḥ.</em></div></div><div id="bb96988" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Only if we are very serious about understanding the science of God is a guru required. We should not try to keep a guru as a matter of fashion. One who has accepted a guru speaks intelligently. He never speaks nonsense. That is the sign of having accepted a bona fide guru. We should certainly offer all respect to the spiritual master, but we should also remember how to carry out his orders. In the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> [4.34] Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself tells us the method of seeking out and approaching the guru:</div></div><div id="bb96989" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic"><em>tad viddhi praṇipātena<br />paripraśnena sevayā<br />upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ<br />jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ</em></div></div><div id="bb96990" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">“Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized souls can impart knowledge unto you because they have seen the truth.” The first process is that of surrender. We have to find an exalted person and willingly surrender before him. The <em>śāstras</em> enjoin that before we take a guru we study him carefully to find out whether we can surrender to him. We should not accept a guru suddenly, out of fanaticism. That is very dangerous. The guru should also study the person who wants to become a disciple to see if he is fit. That is the way a relationship is established between the guru and disciple. Everything is provided, but we must take up the process seriously. Then we can be trained to become a bona fide disciple. First we must find a bona fide guru, establish our relationship with him, and act accordingly. Then our life will be successful, for the guru can enlighten the sincere disciple who is in darkness.</div></div><div id="bb96991" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Everyone is born a rascal and a fool.

Rascal gurus try to avoid these things. We must understand that we are all born rascals and fools and that we have to be enlightened. We have to receive knowledge to make our lives perfect. If we do not perfect our lives, we are defeated. What is this defeat? The struggle for existence. We are trying to obtain a better life, to attain a superior position, and for this we are struggling very hard.

So actually there is no good position in this material world. It is a farce.

The real guru will not manufacture anything. Everything he says is in accordance with the scriptures and the previous <em>ācāryas.</em> He will not give you a mantra and tell you that you will become God in six months. This is not a guru’s business. A guru’s business is to canvass everyone to become a devotee of God. That is the sum and substance of a real guru’s business. Indeed, he has no other business.

At the present moment our consciousness is designated. Someone is thinking, “I am an Englishman,” and another is thinking, “I am an American.” Actually, we do not belong to any of these designations. We are all part and parcel of God; that is our real identity. If everyone simply comes to that consciousness, all the problems of the world will be solved. Then we shall come to know that we are one – the same quality of spirit soul. The same quality of spirit soul is within everyone, although it may be in a different dress.

Its purpose is to make people free from all designations (<em>tat-paratvena nirmalam</em>). When our consciousness becomes purified of all designations, the activities we carry out with our purified senses make us perfect. Eventually, we reach the ideal perfection of human life. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is also a very simple process. It is not necessary to become a great philosopher, scientist, or whatever. We need only chant the holy name of the Lord, understanding that His personality, His name, and His qualities are all absolute.</div></div><div id="bb97029" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Kṛṣṇa consciousness is a great science.

The problems of the world will be solved. This is also the verdict of the <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> the most important and authoritative book of spiritual knowledge. Many of you have heard of the <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> Our movement is based on it. Our movement is approved by all great <em>ācāryas</em> in India – Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Lord Caitanya, and so many others.

Spiritual life does not depend on either poverty or wealth. Spiritual life is transcendental. Consider Arjuna, for instance. Arjuna was a member of a royal family, yet he was a pure devotee of God. And in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> [4.2] Śrī Kṛṣṇa says, <em>evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ:</em> “This supreme science was received through the chain of disciplic succession, and the saintly kings understood it in that way.” In the past, all kings who were saintly understood spiritual science. Therefore, spiritual life does not depend on one’s material condition. Whatever a person’s material condition may be – he may be a king or a pauper – he can still understand spiritual life. Generally people do not know what spiritual life is, and therefore, they unnecessarily criticize us.

By seeing the difference between your self and your body, you come to understand that you are a spirit soul (<em>ahaṁ brahmāsmi</em>).</div></div><div id="bb97058" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Reporter: </strong>Do you think this knowledge should be a part of everyone’s education?</div></div><div id="bb97059" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Śrīla Prabhupāda: </strong>Yes.

Because someone accidentally gets an American body, he thinks, “I am an American.” This is just like thinking “I am a red shirt” just because you are wearing a red shirt. You are not a red shirt; you are a human being. Similarly, this body is like a shirt or coat over the real person – the spirit soul.

From the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> we understand that the genuine seekers are very few: <em>manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye.</em> Out of many millions of people, there may be only one who is interested in spiritual life. Generally, people are interested in eating, sleeping, mating, and defending. So how can we expect to find many followers? It is not difficult to notice that people have lost their spiritual interest. And almost all those who are actually interested are being cheated by so-called spiritualists. You cannot judge a movement simply by the number of its followers. If one man is genuine, then the movement is successful.

The first requirement is that one become educated in spiritual life. Spiritual life is not something one can understand by a few minutes’ talk. There are many philosophy and theology books, but people are not interested in them. That is the difficulty. For instance, the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> is a very long work, and if you try to read this book, it may take many days just to understand one line of it. The <em>Bhāgavatam</em> describes God, the Absolute Truth, but people are not interested. And if, by chance, someone becomes a little interested in spiritual life, he wants something immediate and cheap. Therefore, he is cheated. Actually, human life is meant for austerity and penance. That is the way of Vedic civilization. In Vedic times they would train boys as <em>brahmacārīs;</em> no sex life was allowed at all up to the age of twenty-five. Where is that education now? A <em>brahmacārī</em> is a student who lives a life of complete celibacy and obeys the commands of his guru at the <em>gurukula</em> [school of the spiritual master]. Now schools and colleges are teaching sex from the very beginning, and twelve- or thirteen-year-old boys and girls are having sex. How can they have a spiritual life? Spiritual life means voluntarily accepting some austerities for the sake of God realization. That is why we insist on no illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling, or intoxication for our initiated students. Without these restrictions, any “yoga meditation” or so-called spiritual discipline cannot be genuine.

He does not descend here to meddle with the affairs of temporary necessities, but to deliver the fallen, conditioned souls – the souls, or entities, who have come here to the material world with a motive of enjoyment by the mind and the five organs of sense perception.

The present Ācāryadeva is the tenth disciplic representative from Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī, the original representative of Lord Caitanya who preached this transcendental tradition in its fullness.

We cannot be proud of our past material civilization, which is now a thousand times greater than in days gone by. It is said that we are passing through the age of darkness, the Kali-yuga. What is this darkness? The darkness cannot be due to backwardness in material knowledge, because we now have more of it than formerly. If not we ourselves, our neighbors, at any rate, have plenty of it. Therefore, we must conclude that the darkness of the present age is not due to a lack of material advancement, but that we have lost the clue to our spiritual advancement, which is the prime necessity of human life and the criterion of the highest type of human civilization. Throwing of bombs from airplanes is no advancement of civilization from the primitive, uncivilized practice of dropping big stones on the heads of enemies from the tops of hills. Improvement of the art of killing our neighbors by means of machine guns and poisonous gases is certainly no advancement from primitive barbarism, which prided itself on its art of killing by bows and arrows. Nor does the development of a sense of pampered selfishness prove anything more than intellectual animalism. True human civilization is very different from all these states, and therefore in the <em>Kaṭha Upaniṣad</em> [1.3.14] there is the emphatic call:</div></div><div id="bb97106" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic"><em>uttiṣṭhata jāgrata<br />prāpya varān nibodhata<br />kṣurasya dhārā niśitā duratyayā<br />durgaṁ pathas tat kavayo vadanti</em></div></div><div id="bb97107" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">“Please wake up and try to understand the boon that you now have in this human form of life.

They had discovered that we are not at all material entities, but that we are all spiritual, permanent, and indestructible servants of the Absolute. But because we have, against our better judgment, chosen to completely identify ourselves with this present material existence, our sufferings have multiplied according to the inexorable law of birth and death, with its consequent diseases and anxieties. These sufferings cannot really be mitigated by any provision of material happiness, because matter and spirit are completely different elements. It is just as if you took an aquatic animal out of water and put it on the land, supplying all manner of happiness possible on land. The deadly sufferings of the animal are not capable of being relieved at all until it is taken out of its foreign environment. Spirit and matter are completely contradictory things. All of us are spiritual entities. We cannot have perfect happiness, which is our birthright, however much we may meddle with the affairs of mundane things. Perfect happiness can be ours only when we are restored to our natural state of spiritual existence. This is the distinctive message of our ancient Indian civilization, this is the message of the <em>Gītā,</em> this is the message of the <em>Vedas</em> and the <em>Purāṇas,</em> and this is the message of all the real <em>ācāryas,</em> including our present Ācāryadeva, in the line of Lord Caitanya.</div></div><div id="bb97109" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Gentlemen, although it is imperfectly that we have been enabled by his grace to understand the sublime messages of our Ācāryadeva, Oṁ Viṣṇupāda Paramahaṁsa Parivrājakācārya Śrī Śrīmad Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī Mahārāja, we must admit that we have realized definitely that the divine message from his holy lips is the congenial thing for suffering humanity. All of us should hear him patiently. If we listen to the transcendental sound without unnecessary opposition, he will surely have mercy upon us. The Ācārya’s message is to take us back to our original home, back to God.

Furthermore, we are prepared to challenge the most erudite scholars of the Māyāvāda school and prove that the Personality of Godhead and His transcendental sports in Goloka alone constitute the sublime information of the <em>Vedas.</em> There are explicit indications of this in the <em>Chāndogya Upaniṣad</em> [8.13.1]:</div></div><div id="bb97127" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic"><em>śyāmāc chavalaṁ prapadye<br />śavalāc chyāmaṁ prapadye</em></div></div><div id="bb97128" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">“For receiving the mercy of Kṛṣṇa, I surrender unto His energy (Rādhā), and for receiving the mercy of His energy, I surrender unto Kṛṣṇa.” Also in the <em>Ṛg Veda</em> [1.22.20]:</div></div><div id="bb97129" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic"><em>tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ<br /> sadā paśyanti sūrayaḥ<br />divīva cakṣur ātatam<br />viṣṇor yat paramaṁ padam</em></div></div><div id="bb97130" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">“The lotus feet of Lord Viṣṇu are the supreme objective of all the demigods.

Some spiritual teachers say, “In my opinion you should do this,” but this is not a guru. Such so-called gurus are simply rascals. The genuine guru has only one opinion, and that is the opinion expressed by Kṛṣṇa, Vyāsadeva, Nārada, Arjuna, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and the Six Gosvāmīs. Five thousand years ago Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa spoke the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā,\u003c/em\u003e and Vyāsadeva recorded it. Śrīla Vyāsadeva did not say, “This is my opinion.” Rather, he wrote, \u003cem\u003eśrī-bhagavān uvāca,\u003c/em\u003e that is, “The Supreme Personality of Godhead says.” Whatever Vyāsadeva wrote was originally spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Śrīla Vyāsadeva did not give his own opinion.2e:T68a,“Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, become My devotee, offer obeisances to Me, and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me.” These very instructions were reiterated by all the \u003cem\u003eācāryas,\u003c/em\u003e such as Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, and Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The Six Gosvāmīs also transmitted the same message, and we are simply following in their footsteps. There is no difference. We do not interpret the words of Kṛṣṇa by saying, “In my opinion, the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra represents the human body.” Such interpretations are set forth by rascals. In the world there are many rascal gurus who give their own opinion, but we can challenge any rascal. A rascal guru may say, “I am God,” or, “We are all God.” That is all right, but we should find out from the dictionary what the meaning of \u003cem\u003eGod\u003c/em\u003e is. Generally, a dictionary will tell us that the word \u003cem\u003eGod\u003c/em\u003e indicates the Supreme Being. Thus we may ask such a guru, “Are you the Supreme Being?” If he cannot understand this, then we should give the meaning of \u003cem\u003esupreme.\u003c/em\u003e Any dictionary will inform us that \u003cem\u003esupreme\u003c/em\u003e means “the greatest authority.” We may then ask, “Are you the greatest authority?” Such a rascal guru, even though proclaiming himself "])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"to be God, cannot answer such a question. God is the Supreme Being and the highest authority. No one is equal to Him or greater than Him. Yet there are many guru-gods, many rascals who claim to be the Supreme. Such rascals cannot help us escape the darkness of material existence. They cannot illumine our darkness with the torchlight of spiritual knowledge.2f:T67c,“Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.” Someone may argue, “Where is Kṛṣṇa? I shall surrender to Him.” But no, the process is that we first surrender to Kṛṣṇa’s representative; then we surrender to Kṛṣṇa. Therefore it is said, \u003cem\u003esākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstraiḥ:\u003c/em\u003e the guru is as good as God. When we offer respects to the guru, we are offering respects to God. Because we are trying to be God conscious, it is required that we learn how to offer respects to God through God’s representative. In all the \u003cem\u003eśāstras\u003c/em\u003e the guru is described to be as good as God, but the guru never says, “I am God.” The disciple’s duty is to offer respect to the guru just as he offers respect to God, but the guru never thinks, “My disciples are offering me the same respect they offer to God; therefore I have become God.” As soon as he thinks like this, he becomes a dog instead of God. Therefore Viśvanātha Cakravartī says, \u003cem\u003ekintu prabhor yaḥ priya eva tasya.\u003c/em\u003e Because he is the most confidential servitor of God, the guru is offered the same respect that we offer God. God is always God, guru is always guru. As a matter of etiquette, God is the worshipable God, and guru is the worshiper God (\u003cem\u003esevaka-bhagavān\u003c/em\u003e). Therefore the guru is addressed as \u003cem\u003eprabhupāda.\u003c/em\u003e The word \u003cem\u003eprabhu\u003c/em\u003e means “lord,” and \u003cem\u003epāda\u003c/em\u003e means “position.” Thus \u003cem\u003eprabhupāda\u003c/em\u003e means “he who has taken the position of the Lord.” This is the same as \u003cem\u003esākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstraiḥ.\u003c/em\u003e30:T583,\u003cstrong\u003eŚrīl"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"a Prabhupāda: \u003c/strong\u003eYes. The genuine guru is God’s representative, and he speaks about God and nothing else. The genuine guru is he who has no interest in materialistic life. He is after God, and God only. That is one of the tests of a genuine guru: \u003cem\u003ebrahma-niṣṭham.\u003c/em\u003e He is absorbed in the Absolute Truth. In the \u003cem\u003eMuṇḍaka Upaniṣad\u003c/em\u003e it is stated, \u003cem\u003eśrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭham:\u003c/em\u003e “The genuine guru is well versed in the scriptures and Vedic knowledge, and he is completely dependent on Brahman.” He should know what Brahman [spirit] is and how to become situated in Brahman. These signs are given in the Vedic literature. As I said before, the real guru is God’s representative. He represents the Supreme Lord, just as a viceroy represents a king. The real guru will not manufacture anything.

Lord Caitanya did not bother Himself for the upliftment of this dead world, which is suitably named Martyaloka, the world where everything is destined to die.

The guru is one because he comes in disciplic succession. What Vyāsadeva and Kṛṣṇa taught five thousand years ago is also being taught now. There is no difference between the two instructions. Although hundreds and thousands of \u003cem\u003eācāryas\u003c/em\u003e have come and gone, the message is one. The real guru cannot be two, for the real guru does not speak differently from his predecessors. Some spiritual teachers say, “In my opinion you should do this,” but this is not a guru. Such so-called gurus are simply rascals. The genuine guru has only one opinion, and that is the opinion expressed by Kṛṣṇa, Vyāsadeva, Nārada, Arjuna, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and the Six Gosvāmīs. Five thousand years ago Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa spoke the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā,\u003c/em\u003e and Vyāsadeva recorded it. Śrīla Vyāsadeva did not say, “This is my opinion.” Rather, he wrote, \u003cem\u003eśrī-bhagavān uvāca,\u003c/em\u003e that is, “The Supreme Personality of Godhead says.” Whatever Vyāsadeva wrote was originally spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Śrīla Vyāsadeva did not give his own opinion.39:T68a,“Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, become My devotee, offer obeisances to Me, and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me.” These very instructions were reiterated by all the \u003cem\u003eācāryas,\u003c/em\u003e such as Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, and Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The Six Gosvāmīs also transmitted the same message, and we are simply following in their foot"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"steps. There is no difference. We do not interpret the words of Kṛṣṇa by saying, “In my opinion, the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra represents the human body.” Such interpretations are set forth by rascals. In the world there are many rascal gurus who give their own opinion, but we can challenge any rascal. A rascal guru may say, “I am God,” or, “We are all God.” That is all right, but we should find out from the dictionary what the meaning of \u003cem\u003eGod\u003c/em\u003e is. Generally, a dictionary will tell us that the word \u003cem\u003eGod\u003c/em\u003e indicates the Supreme Being. Thus we may ask such a guru, “Are you the Supreme Being?” If he cannot understand this, then we should give the meaning of \u003cem\u003esupreme.\u003c/em\u003e Any dictionary will inform us that \u003cem\u003esupreme\u003c/em\u003e means “the greatest authority.” We may then ask, “Are you the greatest authority?” Such a rascal guru, even though proclaiming himself to be God, cannot answer such a question. God is the Supreme Being and the highest authority. No one is equal to Him or greater than Him. Yet there are many guru-gods, many rascals who claim to be the Supreme. Such rascals cannot help us escape the darkness of material existence. They cannot illumine our darkness with the torchlight of spiritual knowledge.3a:T67c,“Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.” Someone may argue, “Where is Kṛṣṇa? I shall surrender to Him.” But no, the process is that we first surrender to Kṛṣṇa’s representative; then we surrender to Kṛṣṇa. Therefore it is said, \u003cem\u003esākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstraiḥ:\u003c/em\u003e the guru is as good as God. When we offer respects to the guru, we are offering respects to God. Because we are trying to be God conscious, it is required that we learn how to offer respects to God through God’s representative. In all the \u003cem\u003eśāstras\u003c/em\u003e the guru is described to be as good as God, but the guru never says, “I am God.” The disciple’s duty is to offe"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"r respect to the guru just as he offers respect to God, but the guru never thinks, “My disciples are offering me the same respect they offer to God; therefore I have become God.” As soon as he thinks like this, he becomes a dog instead of God. Therefore Viśvanātha Cakravartī says, \u003cem\u003ekintu prabhor yaḥ priya eva tasya.\u003c/em\u003e Because he is the most confidential servitor of God, the guru is offered the same respect that we offer God. God is always God, guru is always guru. As a matter of etiquette, God is the worshipable God, and guru is the worshiper God (\u003cem\u003esevaka-bhagavān\u003c/em\u003e). Therefore the guru is addressed as \u003cem\u003eprabhupāda.\u003c/em\u003e The word \u003cem\u003eprabhu\u003c/em\u003e means “lord,” and \u003cem\u003epāda\u003c/em\u003e means “position.” Thus \u003cem\u003eprabhupāda\u003c/em\u003e means “he who has taken the position of the Lord.” This is the same as \u003cem\u003esākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstraiḥ.\u003c/em\u003e3b:T583,\u003cstrong\u003eŚrīla Prabhupāda: \u003c/strong\u003eYes. The genuine guru is God’s representative, and he speaks about God and nothing else. The genuine guru is he who has no interest in materialistic life. He is after God, and God only. That is one of the tests of a genuine guru: \u003cem\u003ebrahma-niṣṭham.\u003c/em\u003e He is absorbed in the Absolute Truth. In the \u003cem\u003eMuṇḍaka Upaniṣad\u003c/em\u003e it is stated, \u003cem\u003eśrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭham:\u003c/em\u003e “The genuine guru is well versed in the scriptures and Vedic knowledge, and he is completely dependent on Brahman.” He should know what Brahman [spirit] is and how to become situated in Brahman. These signs are given in the Vedic literature. As I said before, the real guru is God’s representative. He represents the Supreme Lord, just as a viceroy represents a king. The real guru will not manufacture anything. Everything he says is in accordance with the scriptures and the previous \u003cem\u003eācāryas.\u003c/em\u003e He will not give you a mantra and tell you that you will become God in six months.

Of course, to search out a guru is very nice, but if you want a cheap guru, or if you want to be cheated, then you will find many cheating gurus. But if you are sincere, you will find a sincere guru. Because people want everything very cheaply, they are cheated. We ask our students to refrain from illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling, and intoxication. People think that this is all very difficult – a botheration. But if someone else says, “You may do whatever nonsense you like, simply take my mantra,” then people will like him. The point is that people want to be cheated, and therefore cheaters come. No one wants to undergo any austerity. Human life is meant for austerity, but no one is prepared to undergo austerity. Consequently, cheaters come and say, “No austerity. Whatever you like, you do. Simply pay me, and I’ll give you some mantra, and you’ll become God in six months.” All this is going on. If you want to be cheated like this, the cheaters will come.\"},{\"type\":\"content.Record\",\"title\":\"paragraph\",\"id\":269748,\"bb\":97002,\"url_path\":\"/en/library/ssr/2/b97002/\",\"body_value\":\"\u003cstrong\u003eReporter: \u003c/strong\u003eWhat about the person who seriously wants to find spiritual life but who happens to finish up with the wrong guru?\"},{\"type\":\"content.Record\",\"title\":\"paragraph\",\"id\":269749,\"bb\":97003,\"url_path\":\"/en/library/ssr/2/b97003/\",\"body_value\":\"\u003cstrong\u003eŚrīla Prabhupāda: \u003c/strong\u003eIf you simply want an ordinary education, you have to devote so much time, labor, and understanding to it.
