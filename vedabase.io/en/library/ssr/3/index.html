But he never denied the spiritual form known as <em>sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha,</em> or the eternal, all-blissful form of knowledge that existed before the material creation. When he spoke of the Supreme Brahman as impersonal, he meant that the Lord’s <em>sac-cid-ānanda</em> form was not to be confused with a material conception of personality. In the very beginning of his commentary on the <em>Gītā,</em> he maintains that Nārāyaṇa, the Supreme Lord, is transcendental to the material creation. The Lord existed before the creation as the transcendental personality, and He has nothing to do with material personality. Lord Kṛṣṇa is the same Supreme Personality, and He has no connection with a material body. He descends in His spiritual, eternal form, but foolish people mistake His body to be like ours. Śaṅkara’s preaching of impersonalism is especially meant for teaching foolish persons who consider Kṛṣṇa to be an ordinary man composed of matter.</div></div><div id="bb97146" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">No one would care to read the <em>Gītā</em> if it had been spoken by a material man, and certainly Vyāsadeva would not have bothered to incorporate it into the history of the <em>Mahābhārata.</em> According to the above verses, the <em>Mahābhārata</em> is the history of the ancient world, and Vyāsadeva is the writer of this great epic. The <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> is identical with Kṛṣṇa; and because Kṛṣṇa is the Absolute Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no difference between Kṛṣṇa and His words. Therefore the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> is as worshipable as Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself, both being absolute. One who hears the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> “as is” actually hears the words directly from the lotus lips of the Lord. But unfortunate persons say that the <em>Gītā</em> is too antiquated for the modern man, who wants to find out God by speculation or meditation.</div></div><div id="bb97147" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center">- 3 -</div></div><div id="bb97148" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center">I salute Thee, O Kṛṣṇa,<br />O Thou who art the refuge<br />Of ocean-born Lakṣmī<br />And all who take refuge<br />At Thy lotus feet.<br />Thou art indeed<br />The wish-fulfilling tree<br />For Thy devotee.<br />Thy one hand holds a staff<br />For driving cows,<br />And Thy other hand is raised –<br />The thumb touching the tip<br />Of Thy forefinger,<br />Indicating divine knowledge.<br />Salutations to Thee, O Supreme Lord,<br />For Thou art the milker<br />Of the ambrosia of the <em>Gītā.</em></div></div><div id="bb97149" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center">PURPORT</div></div><div id="bb97150" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya explicitly says, “You fools, just worship Govinda and that <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> spoken by Nārāyaṇa Himself,” yet foolish people still conduct their research work to find out Nārāyaṇa; consequently they are wretched, and they waste their time for nothing. Nārāyaṇa is never wretched nor <em>daridra;</em> rather, He is worshiped by the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, as well as by all living entities. Śaṅkara declared himself to be “Brahman,” but he admits Nārāyaṇa, or Kṛṣṇa, to be the Supreme Personality who is beyond the material creation. He offers his respects to Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Brahman, or Para-brahman, because He (Kṛṣṇa) is worshipable by everyone. Only the fools and enemies of Kṛṣṇa, who cannot understand what the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> is (though they make commentaries on it), say, <em>“It is not the personal Kṛṣṇa to whom we have to surrender ourselves utterly, but the unborn, beginningless Eternal who speaks through Kṛṣṇa.”</em> Fools rush in where angels fear to tread. Whereas Śaṅkara, the greatest of the impersonalists, offers his due respects to Kṛṣṇa and His book the <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> the foolish say that “we need not surrender to the personal Kṛṣṇa.” Such unenlightened people do not know that Kṛṣṇa is absolute and that there is no difference between His inside and outside. The difference of inside and outside is experienced in the dual, material world. In the absolute world there is no such difference, because in the absolute everything is spiritual (<em>sac-cid-ānanda</em>), and Nārāyaṇa, or Kṛṣṇa, belongs to the absolute world. In the absolute world there is only the factual personality, and there is no distinction between body and soul.</div></div><div id="bb97151" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center">- 4 -</div></div><div id="bb97152" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center">The <em>Upaniṣads<br /></em>Are like a herd of cows,<br />Lord Kṛṣṇa, son of a cowherd,<br />Is their milker,<br />Arjuna is the calf,<br />The supreme nectar of the <em>Gītā<br /></em>Is the milk,<br />And the wise man<br />Of purified intellect<br />Is the drinker.</div></div><div id="bb97153" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center">PURPORT</div></div><div id="bb97154" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Unless one understands spiritual variegatedness, one cannot understand the transcendental pastimes of the Lord.

There is no end to His name, form, etc., unlike in the material world, where all things have their end.

Does he mean thereby that he is worshiping an ordinary, material man? He worships Kṛṣṇa because he knows that Kṛṣṇa’s birth and activities are all supernatural. As stated in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> [4.9], Kṛṣṇa’s birth and activities are mysterious and transcendental, and therefore only the devotees of Kṛṣṇa can know them perfectly. Śaṅkara was not such a fool that he would accept Kṛṣṇa as an ordinary man and at the same time offer Him all devotional obeisances, knowing Him as the son of Devakī and Vasudeva. According to the <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> only by knowing the transcendental birth and activities of Kṛṣṇa can one attain liberation by acquiring a spiritual form like Kṛṣṇa’s. There are five different kinds of liberation. One who merges into the spiritual aura of Kṛṣṇa, known as the impersonal Brahman effulgence, does not fully develop his spiritual body. But one who fully develops his spiritual existence becomes an associate of Nārāyaṇa or Kṛṣṇa in different spiritual abodes. One who enters into the abode of Nārāyaṇa develops a spiritual form exactly like Nārāyaṇa’s (four-handed), and one who enters into the highest spiritual abode of Kṛṣṇa, known as Goloka Vṛndāvana, develops a spiritual form of two hands like Kṛṣṇa’s. Śaṅkara, as an incarnation of Lord Śiva, knows all these spiritual existences, but he did not disclose them to his then Buddhist followers because it was impossible for them to know about the spiritual world. Lord Buddha preached that void is the ultimate goal, so how could his followers understand spiritual variegatedness? Therefore Śaṅkara said, <em>brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā,</em> or, material variegatedness is false but spiritual variegatedness is fact. In the <em>Padma Purāṇa</em> Lord Śiva has admitted that he had to preach the philosophy of <em>māyā,</em> or illusion, in the Kali-yuga as another edition of the “void” philosophy of Buddha. He had to do this by the order of the Lord for specific reasons. He disclosed his real mind, however, by recommending that people worship Kṛṣṇa, for no one can be saved simply by mental speculations composed of word jugglery and grammatical maneuvers.

But there are many obstinate followers of Śaṅkara who refuse to offer their salutations to Lord Kṛṣṇa and instead mislead innocent persons by injecting materialism into the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> and confusing innocent readers by their commentaries, and consequently the readers never have the opportunity to become blessed by offering salutations to Lord Kṛṣṇa, the cause of all causes.

He gives hints to materialists, impersonalists, mental speculators, “void” philosophers, and all other candidates subjected to the punishment of material miseries – just offer salutations to Lord Kṛṣṇa, who is worshiped by Brahmā, Śiva, Varuṇa, Indra, and all other demigods. He has not mentioned, however, the name of Viṣṇu, because Viṣṇu is identical with Kṛṣṇa. The <em>Vedas</em> and the <em>Upaniṣads</em> are meant for understanding the process by which one can surrender unto Kṛṣṇa. The yogis try to see Him (Kṛṣṇa) within themselves by meditation. In other words, it is for all the demigods and demons who do not know where the ultimate end is that Śaṅkara teaches, and he especially instructs the demons and the fools to offer salutations to Kṛṣṇa and His words, the <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> by following in his footsteps. Only by such acts will the demons be benefited, not by misleading their innocent followers by so-called mental speculations or showbottle meditations. Śaṅkara directly offers salutations to Kṛṣṇa, as if to show the fools, who are searching after light, that <em>here is light like the sun.</em> But the fallen demons are like owls that will not open their eyes on account of their fear of the sunlight itself. These owls will never open their eyes to see the sublime light of Kṛṣṇa and His words, the <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> They will, however, comment on the <em>Gītā</em> with their closed owl-eyes to mislead their unfortunate readers and followers. Śaṅkara, however, discloses the light to his less intelligent followers and shows that the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> and Kṛṣṇa are the only source of light. This is all to teach the sincere seekers of truth to offer salutation to Lord Kṛṣṇa and thus surrender unto Him without misgivings. That is the highest perfection of life, and that is the highest teaching of Śaṅkara, the great learned scholar whose teachings drove the voidist philosophy of Buddha out of India, the land of knowledge. <em>Oṁ tat sat.</em></div></div><div id="bb97173" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">Kṛṣṇa Consciousness Movement, the Genuine Vedic Way</h2></div><div id="bb97174" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify italic"><em>After reading an article on the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement in the</em> Los Angeles Times <em>(January 11, 1970), Śrīla Prabhupāda begins an unusual correspondence with Dr. J.

The impersonal conception of God is a side issue, or one of the three features of God. The Absolute Truth is ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Paramātmā conception is the localized aspect of His omnipresence, and the impersonal conception is the aspect of His greatness and eternity. But all these combined together make the Complete Whole.</div></div><div id="bb97185" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Dr. J. F. Staal’s statement that the Kṛṣṇa cult is a combination of Christian and Hindu religion, as if something manufactured by concoction, is not correct. If Christian, Muhammadan, or Buddhist religions are personal, that is quite welcome. But the Kṛṣṇa religion has been personal from a time long, long ago when Christian, Muhammadan, and Buddhist religions had not yet come into existence. According to the Vedic conception, religion is basically made by the personal God as His laws. Religion cannot be manufactured by man or anyone except God superior to man. Religion is the law of God only.</div></div><div id="bb97186" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Unfortunately, all the swamis who came before me in this country stressed the impersonal aspect of God, without sufficient knowledge of God’s personal aspect. In the <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> therefore, it is said that only less intelligent persons consider that God is originally impersonal but assumes a form when He incarnates. The Kṛṣṇa philosophy, however, based on the authority of the <em>Vedas,</em> is that originally the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His plenary expansion is present in everyone’s heart in His localized aspect, and the impersonal Brahman effulgence is the transcendental light and heat distributed everywhere.</div></div><div id="bb97187" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> it is clearly said that the aim of the Vedic way of searching out the Absolute Truth is to find the personal God. One who is satisfied only with the other aspects of the Absolute Truth, namely the Paramātmā feature or the Brahman feature, is to be considered possessed of a poor fund of knowledge. Recently we have published our <em>Śrī Īśopaniṣad,</em> a Vedic literature, and in this small booklet we have thoroughly discussed this point.</div></div><div id="bb97188" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">As far as the Hindu religion is concerned, there are millions of Kṛṣṇa temples in India, and there is not a single Hindu who does not worship Kṛṣṇa.

In the last paragraph of your letter you have mentioned that you are not irritated at the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra (like some people), but rather like it. This has given me much satisfaction, and I am sending herewith a copy of our magazine, <em>Back to Godhead,</em> issue number 28, in which you will find how the students [at a program at Ohio State University] liked this chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, although all of them were neophytes to this cult of chanting. Actually this chanting is very pleasing to the heart and is the best means of infusing spiritual consciousness, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness, into the hearts of people in general.</div></div><div id="bb97204" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">This is the easiest process of spiritual realization and is recommended in the <em>Vedas.</em> In the <em>Bṛhan-nāradīya Purāṇa</em> it is clearly stated that it is only chanting of the holy name of Hari (Kṛṣṇa) that can save people from the problems of materialistic existence, and there is no other alternative, no other alternative, no other alternative in this age of Kali.</div></div><div id="bb97205" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Western culture is monotheistic, but Westerners are being misled by impersonal Indian speculation.

The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is a boon to them, because they are being really trained to understand Western monotheism under the authoritative Vedic system.

In the <em>Vedas,</em> the chief transcendental vibration <em>oṁkāra</em> is also Kṛṣṇa. <em>Praṇava oṁkāra</em> is the divine substance of the <em>Vedas.</em> Following the <em>Vedas</em> means chanting the Vedic mantras, and no Vedic mantra is complete without <em>oṁkāra.</em> In the <em>Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad, oṁkāra</em> is stated to be the most auspicious sound representation of the Supreme Lord. This is also confirmed again in the <em>Atharva Veda. Oṁkara</em> is the sound representation of the Supreme Lord and is therefore the principal word in the <em>Vedas.</em> In this connection, the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa, says, <em>praṇavaḥ sarva-vedeṣu:</em> “I am the syllable <em>oṁ</em> in all the Vedic mantras.” [<a href="/en/library/bg/7/8/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> 7.8</a>]</div></div><div id="bb97211" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Furthermore, in <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> chapter fifteen, verse 15, Kṛṣṇa says, “I am seated in everyone’s heart.

This point is stressed in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> chapter eight, verse 13, where it is stated that by the mystic yoga process, ultimately vibrating the sacred syllable <em>oṁ,</em> one attains to His supreme spiritual planet. In the <em>Vedānta-sūtras,</em> which you have certainly read, the fourth chapter, <em>adhikaraṇa</em> 4, <em>sūtra</em> 22, states positively, <em>anāvṛttiḥ śabdāt:</em> “By sound vibration one becomes liberated.” By devotional service, by understanding well the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can go to His abode and never come back again to this material condition. How is it possible? The answer is, simply by chanting His name constantly.</div></div><div id="bb97213" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">This is accepted by the exemplary disciple, Arjuna, who has perfectly learned the conclusion of spiritual science from the <em>yogeśvara,</em> the master of mystic knowledge, Kṛṣṇa.

Spiritual life is not described in the <em>Vedas</em> as theoretical, dry, or impersonal. The <em>Vedas</em> aim at the inculcation of pure love of God only, and this harmonious conclusion is practically realized by the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, or by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra.</div></div><div id="bb97218" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">As the goal of spiritual realization is only one, love of God, so the <em>Vedas</em> stand as a single comprehensive whole in the matter of transcendental understanding.

It may mean glorifying, chanting, reciting, talking, and refer to songs, hymns, descriptions, or conversations. The commentators take it that way. Śaṅkara in his commentary merely repeats the word, but Ānandagiri in his <em>vyākhyā</em> classes <em>kīrtana</em> as <em>vedānta-śravaṇaṁ praṇava-japaś ca,</em> “listening to the <em>Vedānta</em> and muttering <em>oṁ</em>” (that the Vedic <em>oṁ</em> is Kṛṣṇa is said in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> where Kṛṣṇa is also identified with many other things, and which is <em>smṛti,</em> but not in the <em>Vedas,</em> which are <em>śruti</em>). Another commentator, Hanumān, in his <em>Paiśāca-bhāṣya,</em> says that <em>kīrtayantaḥ</em> merely means <em>bhāsamānāḥ –</em> “talking [about].”</div></div><div id="bb97227" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">More important, I think, than the precise meaning of this word, is that the entire verse does not require that everyone always engage in <em>kīrtana,</em> but merely states that some great souls do so. This is obvious from the next verse, which states that <em>anye,</em> “others,” engage in <em>jñāna: yajñena … yajanto mām,</em> “worshiping me … with the worship of knowledge.” The <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> is broad-minded and tolerant of a variety of religious approaches, although it also stresses one aspect above all others (i.e., <a href="ENSS03F1.XML" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>sarva-phala-tyāga</em>).*</a></div></div><div id="bb97228" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Finally, in the last <em>sūtra</em> of the <em>Vedānta-sūtra, anāvṛttiḥ śabdāt…, śabda</em> refers to the scripture or to the revelation of the <em>Vedas,</em> as is clear from the context and from the commentators. Śaṅkara quotes a number of texts (ending with <em>ity-ādi-śabdebhyaḥ,</em> “according to these <em>śabdas</em>”) to support this, i.e., to support the statement that “according to the scripture there is no return.” He also refers to <em>śabda</em> in this <em>sūtra</em> by saying <em>mantrārtha-vādādi…,</em> “mantras, descriptions, etc.” Vācaspati Miśra in the <em>Bhāmatī</em> supports this and clarifies it further by adding that a contrary view is <em>śruti-smṛti-virodhaḥ,</em> “in conflict with the <em>smṛti</em> and the <em>śruti.</em>”</div></div><div id="bb97229" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Thanking you once again for your kind attention.</div></div><div id="bb97230" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Yours very sincerely,<br />J.

Lord Caitanya recommended, <em>kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ</em> [“Hari, Kṛṣṇa, is constantly to be praised” (<em>Śikṣāṣṭaka</em> 3)]. Similarly, Madhvācārya quotes, <em>vede rāmāyaṇe caiva hariḥ sarvatra gīyate</em> [“Hari is sung about everywhere in the <em>Vedas</em> and <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em>”]. Similarly, in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> [15.15] the Lord says, <em>vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ</em> [“By all the <em>Vedas,</em> I am to be known”].</div></div><div id="bb97236" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In this way we find all the scriptures aiming at the Supreme Person.

Therefore, we do not disagree when a person glorifies Kṛṣṇa, as Śukadeva did in the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</em> This is also <em>kīrtana.</em> The highest among all Vedic literatures is the proper place for such glorification of the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa, and this is to be well understood from the verse:</div></div><div id="bb97238" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic"><em>nigama-kalpataror galitaṁ phalaṁ<br />śuka-mukhād amṛta-drava-saṁyutam<br />pibata bhāgavataṁ rasam ā-layaṁ<br />muhur aho rasikā bhuvi bhāvukāḥ</em></div></div><div id="bb97239" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">“O expert and thoughtful men, relish <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</em> the mature fruit of the desire tree of Vedic literatures.

This system of social and spiritual division is known as <em>varṇāśrama-dharma.</em> The four <em>varṇas,</em> or social orders, are <em>brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya,</em> and <em>śūdra.</em> The four <em>āśramas,</em> or spiritual orders, are <em>brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha,</em> and <em>sannyāsa.</em> The <em>varṇāśrama</em> system is described in the Vedic scriptures known as the <em>Purāṇas.</em> The goal of this institution of Vedic culture is to educate every man for advancement in knowledge of Kṛṣṇa, or God.

Before coming to the standard of <em>varṇāśrama-dharma</em> there is no question of human civilization. Therefore, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is trying to establish this right system of human civilization, which is known as Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or <em>daiva-varṇāśrama –</em> divine culture.</div></div><div id="bb97288" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In India, the <em>varṇāśrama</em> system has now been taken in a perverted way, and thus a man born in the family of a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> (the highest social order) claims that he should be accepted as a <em>brāhmaṇa.</em> But this claim is not accepted by the <em>śāstra</em> (scripture). One’s forefather may have been a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> according to <em>gotra,</em> or the family hereditary order, but real <em>varṇāśrama-dharma</em> is based on the factual <em>quality</em> one has attained, regardless of birth or heredity. Therefore, we are not preaching the present-day system of the Hindus, especially those who are under the influence of Śaṅkarācārya, for Śaṅkarācārya taught that the Absolute Truth is impersonal, and thus he indirectly denied the existence of God.</div></div><div id="bb97289" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Śaṅkarācārya’s mission was special; he appeared in order to reestablish the Vedic influence after the influence of Buddhism. Because Buddhism was patronized by Emperor Aśoka, twenty-six hundred years ago the Buddhist religion practically pervaded all of India. According to the Vedic literature, Buddha was an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa who had a special power and who appeared for a special purpose. His system of thought, or faith, was accepted widely, but Buddha rejected the authority of the <em>Vedas.</em> While Buddhism was spreading, the Vedic culture was stopped both in India and in other places. Therefore, since Śaṅkarācārya’s only aim was to drive away Buddha’s system of philosophy, he introduced a system called Māyāvāda.</div></div><div id="bb97290" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Strictly speaking, Māyāvāda philosophy is atheism, for it is a process in which one <em>imagines</em> that there is God. This Māyāvāda system of philosophy has been existing since time immemorial. The present Indian system of religion or culture is based on the Māyāvāda philosophy of Śaṅkarācārya, which is a compromise with Buddhist philosophy. According to Māyāvāda philosophy there actually is no God, or if God exists, He is impersonal and all-pervading and can therefore be imagined in any form. This conclusion is not in accord with the Vedic literature. That literature names many demigods, who are worshiped for different purposes, but in every case the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, is accepted as the supreme controller. That is real Vedic culture.</div></div><div id="bb97291" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness does not deny the existence of God and the demigods, but Māyāvāda philosophy denies both; it maintains that neither the demigods nor God exist. For the Māyāvādīs, ultimately all is zero. They say that one may imagine any authority – whether Viṣṇu, Durgā, Lord Śiva, or the sun-god – because these are the demigods generally worshiped in society. But the Māyāvāda philosophy does not in fact accept the existence of any of them. The Māyāvādīs say that because one cannot concentrate one’s mind on the impersonal Brahman, one may imagine any of these forms. This is a new system, called <em>pañcopāsanā.</em> It was introduced by Śaṅkarācārya, but the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> does not teach any such doctrines, and therefore they are not authoritative.</div></div><div id="bb97292" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> accepts the existence of the demigods.

Then other philosophies, such as the Karma-mīmāṁsā philosophy, accept that if one goes on doing his work nicely and honestly, automatically the result will come, without need for one to refer to God. For evidence, the proponents of such theories cite the argument that if one is diseased with an infection and takes medicine to counteract it, the disease will be neutralized. But our argument in this connection is that even if one gives a man the best medicine, he still may die. The results are not always predictable. Therefore, there is a higher authority, <em>daiva-netreṇa,</em> a supreme director.

There is actually no plan to make the woman pregnant, but by a natural sequence when a man and a woman unite, a result is produced. The atheistic theory, which is described in the sixteenth chapter of the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> as asuric, or demoniac, is that actually everything is going on in this way, because of chance and resulting from natural attraction. This demoniac theory supports the idea that if one wants to avoid children, he may use a contraceptive method.</div></div><div id="bb97301" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Actually, however, there is a great plan for everything – the Vedic plan. The Vedic literature gives directions regarding how men and women should unite, how they should beget children, and what the purpose of sex life is. Kṛṣṇa says in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> that sex life sanctioned by the Vedic order, or sex life under the direction of the Vedic rules and regulations, is bona fide and is acceptable to Him. But chance sex life is not acceptable. If by chance one is sexually attracted and there are children, they are called <em>varṇa-saṅkara,</em> unwanted population. That is the way of the lower animals; it is not acceptable for humans. For humans, there is a plan. We cannot accept the theory that there is no plan for human life or that everything is born of chance and material necessity.</div></div><div id="bb97302" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Śaṅkarācārya’s theory that there is no God and that one can go on with his work and imagine God in any form just to keep peace and tranquillity in society is also more or less based on this idea of chance and necessity. Our way, however, which is completely different, is based on authority. It is this divine <em>varṇāśrama-dharma</em> that Kṛṣṇa recommends, not the caste system as it is understood today. This modern caste system is now condemned in India also, and it should be condemned, for the classification of different types of men according to birth is not the Vedic or divine caste system.</div></div><div id="bb97303" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">There are many classes of men in society – some men are engineers, some are medical practitioners, some are chemists, tradesmen, businessmen, and so on. These varieties of classes are not to be determined by birth, however, but by quality. No such thing as the caste-by-birth system is sanctioned by the Vedic literature, nor do we accept it. We have nothing to do with the caste system, which is also at present being rejected by the public in India. Rather, we give everyone the chance to become a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> and thus attain the highest status of life.</div></div><div id="bb97304" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Because at the present moment there is a scarcity of <em>brāhmaṇas</em> (spiritual guides), and <em>kṣatriyas</em> (administrative men), and because the entire world is being ruled by <em>śūdras,</em> or men of the manual laborer class, there are many discrepancies in society. It is to mitigate all these discrepancies that we have taken to this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. If the <em>brāhmaṇa</em> class is actually reestablished, the other orders of social well-being will automatically follow, just as when the brain is perfectly in order, the other parts of the body, such as the arms, the belly, and the legs, all act very nicely.</div></div><div id="bb97305" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The ultimate goal of this movement is to educate people in how to love God. Caitanya Mahāprabhu approves the conclusion that the highest perfection of human life is to learn how to love God. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement has nothing to do with the Hindu religion or any system of religion. No Christian gentleman will be interested in changing his faith from Christian to Hindu. Similarly, no Hindu gentleman of culture will be ready to change to the Christian faith. Such changing is for men who have no particular social status. But everyone will be interested in understanding the philosophy and science of God and taking it seriously. One should clearly understand that the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is not preaching the so-called Hindu religion. We are giving a spiritual culture that can solve all the problems of life, and therefore it is being accepted all over the world.</div></div><div class="mt-10 flex justify-between"><a href="/en/library/ssr/2/" class="inline-flex font-sans items-center px-4 py-2 mr-4 text-base font-medium bg-vb-header-top bg-opacity-30 border border-vb-header-top border-opacity-30 rounded-lg hover:bg-opacity-50"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 448 512" class="mr-2" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M257.5 445.1l-22.2 22.2c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0L7 273c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9L201.4 44.7c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0l22.2 22.2c9.5 9.5 9.3 25-.4 34.3L136.6 216H424c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24v32c0 13.3-10.7 24-24 24H136.6l120.5 114.8c9.8 9.3 10 24.8.4 34.3z"></path></svg>Chapter Two</a><a href="/en/library/ssr/4/" class="inline-flex font-sans items-center px-4 py-2 text-base font-medium bg-vb-header-top bg-opacity-30 border border-vb-header-top border-opacity-30 rounded-lg hover:bg-opacity-50">Chapter Four<svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 448 512" class="ml-2" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M190.5 66.9l22.2-22.2c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0L441 239c9.4 9.4 9.4 24.6 0 33.9L246.6 467.3c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0l-22.2-22.2c-9.5-9.5-9.3-25 .4-34.3L311.4 296H24c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24v-32c0-13.3 10.7-24 24-24h287.4L190.9 101.2c-9.8-9.3-10-24.8-.4-34.3z"></path></svg></a></div></main></div><div id="footer" class="mt-auto pt-3 mb-6 text-sm text-vb-normal-text/80 text-center"><div class="px-4 py-4 w-full max-w-screen-xl mx-auto md:px-8 text-sm text-vb-normal-text/80"><div class="py-2 px-3 border border-dashed border-vb-normal-text/15 text-justify relative "><a href="/en/donate/" class="z-20 float-right my-2 ml-3 w-auto border border-vb-action-border bg-vb-action-bg hover:bg-vb-action-bg/80 rounded-md text-vb-action-text py-3 px-6 text-center disabled:opacity-50">Donate</a><span class="flex-grow">Thanks to <span>Vinod Bapat and Meenal Bapat; Mahavisnupriya dasi &amp; Gostavihari das;   Kuldip Persaud; Gagan Kangovi; Rajendra and Geeta Ramchandani; NIOS - North American Institute for Oriental and Classical Studies; Jaykumar Prabhakar; Anantha SriSimha das, Spore; Bharat Vyas; HG Lakshmipati Narayan Das; HG Ragatmika Gopika Devi Dasi; Shri Chander Mohan Gilhotra; HG Prashant Mukund Das; Shri Trilok Singh Grover; Aneesh Koppula; Ronak Talati; Bhargav Ashok; J.K Ahuja; Akiralali; Radhapati Das; Bimal Gupta; Rajasa das; Aishwarya Balaraj; Yogendra Sharad Puranik; Riya and Tejal Chopade; Devarajula Pradeep Kumar (Saroornagar, Hyderabad); Late Chetana Dilip Bhatt; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/indradyumna-swami">Indradyumna Swami</a>; Sachin; Geetanjali Nath; Mario; Joeie; Susheela and Rama Krishna Reddy Patlolla; Jai Devaki Parks; Ashmi Chakraborty; Hari-kirtana das; Ramesta das; Prasad Buddhavarapu; dasa; Kresna Sucandra; Late Mr. S.

When he spoke of the Supreme Brahman as impersonal, he meant that the Lord’s \u003cem\u003esac-cid-ānanda\u003c/em\u003e form was not to be confused with a material conception of personality. In the very beginning of his commentary on the \u003cem\u003eGītā,\u003c/em\u003e"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1," he maintains that Nārāyaṇa, the Supreme Lord, is transcendental to the material creation. The Lord existed before the creation as the transcendental personality, and He has nothing to do with material personality. Lord Kṛṣṇa is the same Supreme Personality, and He has no connection with a material body. He descends in His spiritual, eternal form, but foolish people mistake His body to be like ours. Śaṅkara’s preaching of impersonalism is especially meant for teaching foolish persons who consider Kṛṣṇa to be an ordinary man composed of matter.2e:T725,Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya explicitly says, “You fools, just worship Govinda and that \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e spoken by Nārāyaṇa Himself,” yet foolish people still conduct their research work to find out Nārāyaṇa; consequently they are wretched, and they waste their time for nothing. Nārāyaṇa is never wretched nor \u003cem\u003edaridra;\u003c/em\u003e rather, He is worshiped by the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, as well as by all living entities. Śaṅkara declared himself to be “Brahman,” but he admits Nārāyaṇa, or Kṛṣṇa, to be the Supreme Personality who is beyond the material creation. He offers his respects to Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Brahman, or Para-brahman, because He (Kṛṣṇa) is worshipable by everyone. Only the fools and enemies of Kṛṣṇa, who cannot understand what the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e is (though they make commentaries on it), say, \u003cem\u003e“It is not the personal Kṛṣṇa to whom we have to surrender ourselves utterly, but the unborn, beginningless Eternal who speaks through Kṛṣṇa.”\u003c/em\u003e Fools rush in where angels fear to tread. Whereas Śaṅkara, the greatest of the impersonalists, offers his due respects to Kṛṣṇa and His book the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā,\u003c/em\u003e the foolish say that “we need not surrender to the personal Kṛṣṇa.” Such unenlightened people do not know that Kṛṣṇa is absolute and that there is no difference between His inside and outside. The difference of inside "])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"and outside is experienced in the dual, material world. In the absolute world there is no such difference, because in the absolute everything is spiritual (\u003cem\u003esac-cid-ānanda\u003c/em\u003e), and Nārāyaṇa, or Kṛṣṇa, belongs to the absolute world. In the absolute world there is only the factual personality, and there is no distinction between body and soul.2f:T941,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Śaṅkara describes Him as the son of Vasudeva and Devakī. Does he mean thereby that he is worshiping an ordinary, material man? He worships Kṛṣṇa because he knows that Kṛṣṇa’s birth and activities are all supernatural. As stated in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e [4.9], Kṛṣṇa’s birth and activities are mysterious and transcendental, and therefore only the devotees of Kṛṣṇa can know them perfectly. Śaṅkara was not such a fool that he would accept Kṛṣṇa as an ordinary man and at the same time offer Him all devotional obeisances, knowing Him as the son of Devakī and Vasudeva. According to the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā,\u003c/em\u003e only by knowing the transcendental birth and activities of Kṛṣṇa can one attain liberation by acquiring a spiritual form like Kṛṣṇa’s. There are five different kinds of liberation. One who merges into the spiritual aura of Kṛṣṇa, known as the impersonal Brahman effulgence, does not fully develop his spiritual body. But one who fully develops his spiritual existence becomes an associate of Nārāyaṇa or Kṛṣṇa in different spiritual abodes. One who enters into the abode of Nārāyaṇa develops a spiritual form exactly like Nārāyaṇa’s (four-handed), and one who enters into the highest spiritual abode of Kṛṣṇa, known as Goloka Vṛndāvana, develops a spiritual form of two hands like Kṛṣṇa’s. Śaṅkara, as an incarnation of Lord Śiva, knows all these spiritual existences, but he did not disclose them to his then Buddhist followers because it was impossible for them to know about the spiritual world. Lord Buddha preached that void is the ultimate goal, so how could his followers understand spiritual variegatedness? Therefore Śaṅkara said, \u003cem\u003ebrahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā,\u003c/em\u003e or, material variegatedness is false but spiritual variegatedness is fact. In the \u003cem\u003ePadma Purāṇa\u003c/em\u003e Lord Śiva has admitted that he had to preach the philosophy of \u003cem\u003emāyā,\u003c/em\u003e or illusion, in the Kali-yuga as another edition of the “void” philosophy of Buddha. He had to do this by the order of the Lord for specific reasons. He disclosed his real mind, however, by recommending that people worship Kṛṣṇa, for no one can be saved simply by mental speculations composed of word jugglery and grammatical maneuvers. Śaṅkara further instructs:"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"30:T8ee,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"By recitation of the ninth verse of his meditation, quoted from the \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,\u003c/em\u003e Śaṅkara has indicated that Lord Kṛṣṇa is worshipable by one and all, including himself. He gives hints to materialists, impersonalists, mental speculators, “void” philosophers, and all other candidates subjected to the punishment of material miseries – just offer salutations to Lord Kṛṣṇa, who is worshiped by Brahmā, Śiva, Varuṇa, Indra, and all other demigods. He has not mentioned, however, the name of Viṣṇu, because Viṣṇu is identical with Kṛṣṇa. The \u003cem\u003eVedas\u003c/em\u003e and the \u003cem\u003eUpaniṣads\u003c/em\u003e are meant for understanding the process by which one can surrender unto Kṛṣṇa. The yogis try to see Him (Kṛṣṇa) within themselves by meditation.

Śaṅkara’s preaching of impersonalism is especially meant for teaching foolish persons who consider Kṛṣṇa to be an ordinary man composed of matter.35:T725,Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya explicitly says, “You fools, just worship Govinda and that \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e spoken by Nārāyaṇa Himself,” yet foolish people still conduct their research work to find out Nārāyaṇa; consequently they are wretched, and they waste their time for nothing.

Śaṅkara declared himself to be “Brahman,” but he admits Nārāyaṇa, or Kṛṣṇa, to be the Supreme Personality who is beyond the material creation. He offers his respects to Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Brahman, or Para-brahman, because He (Kṛṣṇa) is worshipable by everyone.

Does he mean thereby that he is worshiping an ordinary, material man? He worships Kṛṣṇa because he knows that Kṛṣṇa’s birth and activities are all supernatural. As stated in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e [4.9], Kṛṣṇa’s birth and activities are mysterious and transcendental, and therefore only the devotees of Kṛṣṇa can know them perfectly. Śaṅkara was not such a fool that he would accept Kṛṣṇa as an ordinary man and at the same time offer Him all devotional obeisances, knowing Him as the son of Devakī and Vasudeva. According to the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā,\u003c/em\u003e only by knowing the transcendental birth and activities of Kṛṣṇa can one attain liberation by acquiring a spiritual form like Kṛṣṇa’s. There are five different kinds of liberation. One who merges into the spiritual aura of Kṛṣṇa, known as the impersonal Brahman effulgence, does not fully develop his spiritual body. But one who fully develops his spiritual existence becomes an associate of Nārāyaṇa or Kṛṣṇa in different spiritual abodes. One who enters into the abode of Nārāyaṇa develops a spiritual form exactly like Nārāyaṇa’s (four-handed), and one who enters into the highest spiritual abode of Kṛṣṇa, known as Goloka Vṛndāvana, develops a spiritual form of two hands like Kṛṣṇa’s. Śaṅkara, as an incarnation of Lord Śiva, knows all these spiritual existences, but he did not disclose them to his then Buddhist followers because it was impossible for them to know about the spiritual world. Lord Buddha preached that void is the ultimate goal, so how could his followers understand spiritual variegatedness? Therefore Śaṅkara said, \u003cem\u003ebrahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā,\u003c/em\u003e or, material variegatedness is false but spiritual variegatedness is fact. In the \u003cem\u003ePadma Purāṇa\u003c/em\u003e Lord Śiva has admitted that he had to preach the philosophy of \u003cem\u003emāyā,\u003c/em\u003e or illusion, in the Kali-yuga as another edition of the “void” philosophy of Buddha. He had to do this by the order of the Lord for specific reasons.

He gives hints to materialists, impersonalists, mental speculators, “void” philosophers, and all other candidates subjected to the punishment of material miseries – just offer salutations to Lord Kṛṣṇa, who is worshiped by Brahmā, Śiva, Varuṇa, Indra, and all other demigods.
