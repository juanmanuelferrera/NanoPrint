Jesus said that one should glorify the name of God, but yesterday I heard one theologian say that God has no name – that we can call Him only “Father.” A son may call his father “Father,” but the father also has a specific name. Similarly, “God” is the general name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose specific name is Kṛṣṇa.

The main point is to follow the injunctions of the Vedic scriptures that recommend chanting the name of God in this age. The easiest way is to chant the <em>mahā-mantra:</em> Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. <em>Rāma</em> and <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> are names of God, and <em>Hare</em> is the energy of God. So when we chant the <em>mahā-mantra,</em> we address God together with His energy. This energy is of two kinds, the spiritual and the material. At present we are in the clutches of the material energy. Therefore we pray to Kṛṣṇa that He may kindly deliver us from the service of the material energy and accept us into the service of the spiritual energy. That is our whole philosophy. <em>Hare Kṛṣṇa</em> means, “O energy of God, O God [Kṛṣṇa], please engage me in Your service.” It is our nature to render service. Somehow or other we have come to the service of material things, but when this service is transformed into the service of the spiritual energy, then our life is perfect. To practice <em>bhakti-yoga</em> [loving service to God] means to become free from designations like “Hindu,” “Muslim,” “Christian,” this or that, and simply to serve God. We have created Christian, Hindu, and Muhammadan religions, but when we come to a religion without designations, in which we don’t think we are Hindus or Christians or Muhammadans, then we can speak of pure religion, or <em>bhakti.</em></div></div><div id="bb97319" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Father Emmanuel: </strong><em>Mukti</em>?</div></div><div id="bb97320" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Śrīla Prabhupāda: </strong>No, <em>bhakti.</em> When we speak of <em>bhakti, mukti</em> [liberation from material miseries] is included.

He is like the sun, which is so powerful that it can purify even urine – something impossible for us to do. Kṛṣṇa is also like a king, who may order a murderer to be hanged but who himself is beyond punishment because he is very powerful. Eating food first offered to the Lord is also something like a soldier’s killing during wartime. In a war, when the commander orders a man to attack, the obedient soldier who kills the enemy will get a medal. But if the same soldier kills someone on his own, he will be punished. Similarly, when we eat only <em>prasāda</em> [the remnants of food offered to Kṛṣṇa], we do not commit any sin.

So let’s kindly cooperate and chant, and if you have a prejudice against chanting the name Kṛṣṇa, then chant “Christos” or “Kṛṣṭa” – there is no difference. Śrī Caitanya said: <em>nāmnām akāri bahudhā nija-sarva-śaktiḥ.</em> “God has millions and millions of names, and because there is no difference between God’s name and Himself, each one of these names has the same potency as God.” Therefore, even if you accept designations like “Hindu,” “Christian,” or “Muhammadan,” if you simply chant the name of God found in your own scriptures, you will attain the spiritual platform.

In preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness we ask people not to eat any kind of meat, and my disciples strictly follow this principle. But if, under certain circumstances, others are obliged to eat meat, then they should eat the flesh of some lower animal. Don’t kill cows. It is the greatest sin.

Actually, you will not even have a human society until this cruel practice of maintaining slaughterhouses is stopped. And although animal killing may sometimes be necessary for survival, at least the mother animal, the cow, should not be killed. That is simply human decency. In the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement our practice is that we don’t allow the killing of any animals. Kṛṣṇa says, <em>patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati:</em> “Vegetables, fruits, milk, and grains should be offered to Me in devotion.” [<a href="/en/library/bg/9/26/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> 9.26</a>] We take only the remnants of Kṛṣṇa’s food (<em>prasāda</em>). The trees offer us many varieties of fruits, but the trees are not killed. Of course, one living entity is food for another living entity, but that does not mean you can kill your mother for food. Cows are innocent; they give us milk. You take their milk – and then kill them in the slaughterhouse. This is sinful.</div></div><div id="bb97403" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Student: </strong>Śrīla Prabhupāda, Christianity’s sanction of meat-eating is based on the view that lower species of life do not have a soul like the human being’s.</div></div><div id="bb97404" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Śrīla Prabhupāda: </strong>That is foolishness.

What are the different characteristics of the cow and the man? If we find a difference in characteristics, then we can say that in the animal there is no soul. But if we see that the animal and the human being have the same characteristics, then how can you say that the animal has no soul? The general symptoms are that the animal eats, you eat; the animal sleeps, you sleep; the animal mates, you mate; the animal defends, and you defend.

Similarly, the bodies of the different species are just like different types of dress. They are soul, a part and parcel of God. Suppose a man has two sons, not equally meritorious. One may be a Supreme Court judge and the other may be a common laborer, but the father claims both as his sons. He does not make the distinction that the son who is a judge is very important and the worker-son is not important.

In the human body there is developed consciousness. Even a tree has a soul, but a tree’s consciousness is not very developed. If you cut a tree it does not resist. Actually, it does resist, but only to a very small degree. There is a scientist named Jagadish Chandra Bose who has made a machine which shows that trees and plants are able to feel pain when they are cut. And we can see directly that when someone comes to kill an animal, it resists, it cries, it makes a horrible sound. So it is a matter of the development of consciousness. But the soul is there within all living beings.</div></div><div id="bb97409" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Cardinal Daniélou: </strong>But metaphysically, the life of man is sacred.

The animal eats to maintain his body, and you also eat in order to maintain your body. The cow eats grass in the field, and the human being eats meat from a huge slaughterhouse full of modern machines. But just because you have big machines and a ghastly scene, while the animal simply eats grass, this does not mean that you are so advanced that only within your body is there a soul and that there is not a soul within the body of the animal. That is illogical.

So metaphysically search out why you believe that there is no soul within the animal – that is metaphysics. If you are thinking metaphysically, that’s all right. But if you are thinking like an animal, then what is the use of your metaphysical study? <em>Metaphysical</em> means “above the physical” or, in other words, “spiritual.” In the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> Kṛṣṇa says, <em>sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya:</em> “In every living being there is a spirit soul.” That is metaphysical understanding.

At present we are in the clutches of the material energy. Therefore we pray to Kṛṣṇa that He may kindly deliver us from the service of the material energy and accept us into the service of the spiritual energy. That is our whole philosophy. \u003cem\u003eHare Kṛṣṇa\u003c/em\u003e means, “O energy of God, O God [Kṛṣṇa], please engage me in Your service.” It is our nature to render service. Somehow or other we have come to the service of material things, but when this service is transformed into the service of the spiritual energy, then our life is perfect. To practice \u003cem\u003ebhakti-yoga\u003c/em\u003e [loving service to God] means to become free from designations like “Hindu,” “Muslim,” “Christian,” this or that, and simply to serve God.

He is like the sun, which is so powerful that it can purify even urine – something impossible for us to do. Kṛṣṇa is also like a king, who may order a murderer to be hanged but who himself is beyond punishment because he is very powerful.

Similarly, when we eat only \u003cem\u003eprasāda\u003c/em\u003e [the remnants of food offered to Kṛṣṇa], we do not commit any sin. This is confirmed in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e [3.13]:2f:T4cd,\u003cstrong\u003eŚrīla Prabhupāda: \u003c/strong\u003eYes – in the animal kingdom. But the civilized human being, the religious human being, is not meant to kill and eat animals. If you stop killing animals and chant the holy name Christ, everything will be perfect. I have not come to teach you, but only to request you to please chant the name of God. The Bible also demands this of you. So let’s kindly cooperate and chant, and if you have a prejudice against chanting the name Kṛṣṇa, then chant “Christos” or “Kṛṣṭa” – there is no difference.

Human life is meant for self-realization – to learn how to love God. That is the actual duty of man. Whether you discharge this duty as a Hindu, a Christian, or a Muhammadan, it doesn’t matter – but discharge it!30:T4db,\u003cstrong\u003eŚrīla Prabhupāda: \u003c/strong\u003eWhen there is no other food, someone may eat meat in order to keep from starving.

The easiest way is to chant the \u003cem\u003emahā-mantra:\u003c/em\u003e Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. \u003cem\u003eRāma\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eKṛṣṇa\u003c/em\u003e are names of God, and \u003cem\u003eHare\u003c/em\u003e is the energy of God. So when we chant the \u003cem\u003emahā-mantra,\u003c/em\u003e we address God together with His energy. This energy is of two kinds, the spiritual and the material. At present we are in the clutches of the material energy. Therefore we pray to Kṛṣṇa that He may kindly deliver us from the service of the material energy and accept us into the service of the spiritual energy. That is our whole philosophy. \u003cem\u003eHare Kṛṣṇa\u003c/em\u003e means, “O energy of God, O God [Kṛṣṇa], please engage me in Your service.” It is our nature to render service. Somehow or other we have come to the service of material things, but when this service is transformed into the service of the spiritual energy, then our life is perfect. To practice \u003cem\u003ebhakti-yoga\u003c/em\u003e [loving service to God] means to become free from designations like “Hindu,” “Muslim,” “Chris"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"tian,” this or that, and simply to serve God. We have created Christian, Hindu, and Muhammadan religions, but when we come to a religion without designations, in which we don’t think we are Hindus or Christians or Muhammadans, then we can speak of pure religion, or \u003cem\u003ebhakti.\u003c/em\u003e34:T444,“If someone offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or a little water, I will accept it.” We offer Kṛṣṇa only the kind of food He demands, and then we eat the remnants. If offering vegetarian food to Kṛṣṇa were sinful, then it would be Kṛṣṇa’s sin, not ours. But God is \u003cem\u003eapāpa-viddha –\u003c/em\u003e sinful reactions are not applicable to Him. He is like the sun, which is so powerful that it can purify even urine – something impossible for us to do. Kṛṣṇa is also like a king, who may order a murderer to be hanged but who himself is beyond punishment because he is very powerful. Eating food first offered to the Lord is also something like a soldier’s killing during wartime. In a war, when the commander orders a man to attack, the obedient soldier who kills the enemy will get a medal. But if the same soldier kills someone on his own, he will be punished. Similarly, when we eat only \u003cem\u003eprasāda\u003c/em\u003e [the remnants of food offered to Kṛṣṇa], we do not commit any sin. This is confirmed in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e [3.13]:35:T4cd,\u003cstrong\u003eŚrīla Prabhupāda: \u003c/strong\u003eYes – in the animal kingdom. But the civilized human being, the religious human being, is not meant to kill and eat animals. If you stop killing animals and chant the holy name Christ, everything will be perfect. I have not come to teach you, but only to request you to please chant the name of God. The Bible also demands this of you. So let’s kindly cooperate and chant, and if you have a prejudice against chanting the name Kṛṣṇa, then chant “Christos” or “Kṛṣṭa” – there is no difference. Śrī Caitanya said: \u003cem\u003enāmnām akāri bahudhā nija-sarva-śaktiḥ.\u003c/em\u003e “God has million"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"s and millions of names, and because there is no difference between God’s name and Himself, each one of these names has the same potency as God.” Therefore, even if you accept designations like “Hindu,” “Christian,” or “Muhammadan,” if you simply chant the name of God found in your own scriptures, you will attain the spiritual platform. Human life is meant for self-realization – to learn how to love God. That is the actual duty of man. Whether you discharge this duty as a Hindu, a Christian, or a Muhammadan, it doesn’t matter – but discharge it!"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"2b:[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"flex flex-col min-h-screen text-vb-normal-text\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"$L21\",null,{\"className\":\"w-full left-0 z-30 bg-vb-body/95\",\"children\":[\"$\",\"$L22\",null,{\"mainMenu\":\"$L2c\",\"page\":{\"id\":270051,\"meta\":{\"type\":\"books.Chapter\",\"slug\":\"4\",\"show_in_menus\":false,\"seo_title\":\"\",\"search_description\":\"\",\"first_published_at\":null,\"alias_of\":null,\"locale\":\"en\"},\"title\":\"Chapter Four\",\"chapter_name\":\"Chapter Four\",\"chapter_title\":\"Understanding Kṛṣṇa and Christ\",\"language_menu\":[{\"display_name\":\"አማርኛ (Ethiopian)\",\"language_code\":\"am\",\"enabled\":false,\"url_path\":\"/am/\"},{\"display_name\":\"Български (Bulgarian)\",\"language_code\":\"bg\",\"enabled\":false,\"url_path\":\"/bg/\"},{\"display_name\":\"Čeština (Czech)\",\"language_code\":\"cs\",\"enabled\":false,\"url_path\":\"/cs/\"},{\"display_name\":\"Dansk (Danish)\",\"language_code\":\"da\",\"enabled\":false,\"url_path\":\"/da/\"},{\"display_name\":\"Deutsch (German)\",\"language_code\":\"de\",\"enabled\":false,\"url_path\":\"/de/\"},{\"display_name\":\"English\",\"language_code\":\"en\",\"enabled\":true,\"url_path\":\"/en/library/ssr/4/\"},{\"display_name\":\"Español (Spanish)\",\"language_code\":\"es\",\"enabled\":true,\"url_path\":\"/es/library/ssr/4/\"},{\"display_name\":\"Eesti keel (Estonian)\",\"language_code\":\"et\",\"enabled\":false,\"url_path\":\"/et/\"},{\"display_name\":\"Suomen kieli (Finnish)\",\"language_code\":\"fi\",\"enabled\":false,\"url_path\":\"/fi/\"},{\"display_name\":\"Français (French)\",\"language_code\":\"fr\",\"enabled\":false,\"url_path\":\"/fr/\"},{\"display_name\":\"Hrvatski (Croatian)\",\"language_code\":\"hr\",\"enabled\":true,\"url_path\":\"/hr/library/ssr/4/\"},{\"display_name\":\"Magyar (Hungarian)\",\"language_code\":\"hu\",\"enabled\":false,\"url_path\":\"/hu/\"},{\"display_name\":\"한국어 (Korean)\",\"language_code\":\"ko\",\"enabled\":false,\"url_path\":\"/ko/\"},{\"display_name\":\"Lietuvių kalba (Lithuanian)\",\"language_code\":\"lt\",\"enabled\":false,\"url_path\":\"/lt/\"},{\"display_name\":\"Nederlands (Dutch)\",\"language_code\":\"nl\",\"enabled\":true,\"url_path\":\"/nl/library/ssr/4/\"},{\"display_name\":\"Polski (Polish)\",\"language_code\":\"pl\",\"enabled\":false,\"url_path\":\"/pl/\"},{\"display_name\":\"Português (Portuguese)\",\"language_code\":\"pt-br\",\"enabled\":false,\"url_path\":\"/pt-br/\"},{\"display_name\":\"Русский (Russian)\",\"language_code\":\"ru\",\"enabled\":false,\"url_path\":\"/ru/\"},{\"display_name\":\"Slovenčina (Slovak)\",\"language_code\":\"sk\",\"enabled\":false,\"url_path\":\"/sk/\"},{\"display_name\":\"Slovenščina (Slovenian)\",\"language_code\":\"sl\",\"enabled\":false,\"url_path\":\"/sl/\"},{\"display_name\":\"українська мова (Ukrainian)\",\"language_code\":\"uk\",\"enabled\":false,\"url_path\":\"/uk/\"},{\"display_name\":\"isiZulu (Zulu)\",\"language_code\":\"zu\",\"enabled\":false,\"url_path\":\"/zu/\"}],\"breadcrumb\":[{\"url_path\":\"/en/library/\",\"title\":\"Library\"},{\"url_path\":\"/en/library/ssr/\",\"title\":\"The Science of Self-Realization\"}],\"url_path\":\"/en/library/ssr/4/\",\"bb\":97306,\"has_advanced_view\":false,\"pager\":{\"previous\":{\"url_path\":\"/en/library/ssr/3/\",\"title\":\"Chapter Three\",\"has_advanced_view\":false,\"translations\":[\"en\",\"es\",\"hr\",\"nl\"]},\"next\":{\"url_path\":\"/en/library/ssr/5/\",\"title\":\"Chapter Five\",\"has_advanced_view\":false,\"translations\":[\"en\",\"es\",\"hr\",\"nl\"]}},\"child_items\":[{\"section\":\"before-verses\",\"section_title\":\"Before Verses\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"content.Record\",\"title\":\"heading\",\"id\":270052,\"bb\":97308,\"url_path\":\"/en/library/ssr/4/b97308/\",\"body_value\":\"Kṛṣṇa or Christ – The Name Is the Same\"},{\"type\":\"content.Record\",\"title\":\"paragraph_intro\",\"id\":270053,\"bb\":97309,\"url_path\":\"/en/library/ssr/4/b97309/\",\"body_value\":\"\u003cem\u003eIt is 1974.
