The hand of a body is a complete unit only as long as it is attached to the complete body. When the hand is severed from the body, it may appear like a hand, but it actually has none of the potencies of a hand.

A living being who lives in the mundane world has four defects: (1) he is certain to commit mistakes; (2) he is subject to illusion; (3) he has a propensity to cheat others; and (4) his senses are imperfect. No one with these four imperfections can deliver perfect knowledge. The <em>Vedas</em> are not produced by such an imperfect creature.

The elements of nature – earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and ego – all belong to the Lord’s inferior, material energy (<em>aparā prakṛti</em>), whereas the living being, the organic energy, is His superior energy (<em>parā prakṛti</em>). Both of these <em>prakṛtis,</em> or energies, are emanations from the Lord, and ultimately He is the controller of everything that exists. There is nothing in the universe that does not belong to either the <em>parā</em> or the <em>aparā prakṛti;</em> therefore everything is the property of the Supreme Being.</div></div><div id="bb93477" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Because the Supreme Being, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, is the complete person, He has complete and perfect intelligence to adjust everything by means of His different potencies. The Supreme Being is often compared to a fire, and everything organic and inorganic is compared to the heat and light of that fire. Just as fire distributes energy in the form of heat and light, the Lord displays His energy in different ways. He thus remains the ultimate controller, sustainer and dictator of everything. He is the possessor of all potencies, the knower of everything and the benefactor of everyone. He is full of inconceivable opulence, power, fame, beauty, knowledge and renunciation.</div></div><div id="bb93478" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">One should therefore be intelligent enough to know that except for the Lord no one is a proprietor of anything.

The cow, for instance, gives milk, but she does not drink that milk: she eats grass and straw, and her milk is designated as food for human beings. Such is the arrangement of the Lord. Thus we should be satisfied with those things He has kindly set aside for us, and we should always consider to whom those things we possess actually belong.</div></div><div id="bb93479" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Take, for example, our dwelling, which is made of earth, wood, stone, iron, cement and so many other material things.

We can simply bring them together and transform them into different shapes by our labor.

The human race should take the Vedic wisdom of <em>Śrī Īśopaniṣad</em> and not quarrel over material possessions. One must be satisfied with whatever privileges are given to him by the mercy of the Lord. There can be no peace if the communists or capitalists or any other party claims proprietorship over the resources of nature, which are entirely the property of the Lord. The capitalists cannot curb the communists simply by political maneuvering, nor can the communists defeat the capitalists simply by fighting for stolen bread. If they do not recognize the proprietorship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, all the property they claim to be their own is stolen. Consequently they will be liable to punishment by the laws of nature. Nuclear bombs are in the hands of both communists and capitalists, and if both do not recognize the proprietorship of the Supreme Lord, it is certain that these bombs will ultimately ruin both parties.

They must be intelligent enough to realize the importance and aim of human life. The Vedic literature is meant for humanity and not for cats and dogs. Cats and dogs can kill other animals for food without incurring sin, but if a man kills an animal for the satisfaction of his uncontrolled taste buds, he is responsible for breaking the laws of nature. Consequently he must be punished.</div></div><div id="bb93482" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The standard of life for human beings cannot be applied to animals. The tiger does not eat rice and wheat or drink cow’s milk, because he has been given food in the shape of animal flesh. Among the many animals and birds, some are vegetarian and others are carnivorous, but none of them transgress the laws of nature, which have been ordained by the will of the Lord. Animals, birds, reptiles and other lower life forms strictly adhere to the laws of nature; therefore there is no question of sin for them, nor are the Vedic instructions meant for them. Human life alone is a life of responsibility.</div></div><div id="bb93483" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">It is wrong, however, to think that simply by becoming a vegetarian one can avoid transgressing the laws of nature. Vegetables also have life, and while it is nature’s law that one living being is meant to feed on another, for human beings the point is to recognize the Supreme Lord. Thus one should not be proud of being a strict vegetarian. Animals do not have developed consciousness by which to recognize the Lord, but a human being is sufficiently intelligent to take lessons from the Vedic literature and thereby know how the laws of nature are working and derive profit out of such knowledge. If a man neglects the instructions of the Vedic literature, his life becomes very risky. A human being is therefore required to recognize the authority of the Supreme Lord and become His devotee. He must offer everything for the Lord’s service and partake only of the remnants of food offered to the Lord. This will enable him to discharge his duty properly. In the <a href="/en/library/bg/9/26/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (9.26)</a> the Lord directly states that He accepts vegetarian food from the hands of a pure devotee. Therefore a human being should not only become a strict vegetarian but should also become a devotee of the Lord, offer the Lord all his food and then partake of such <em>prasādam,</em> or the mercy of God. Only those who act in this way can properly discharge the duties of human life. Those who do not offer their food to the Lord eat nothing but sin and subject themselves to various types of distress, which are the results of sin (<a href="/en/library/bg/3/13/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> 3.13</a>).</div></div><div id="bb93484" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The root of sin is deliberate disobedience to the laws of nature through disregarding the proprietorship of the Lord.

Conversely, one who is sober, who knows the laws of nature, and who is not influenced by unnecessary attachment or aversion is sure to be recognized by the Lord and thus become eligible to go back to Godhead, back to the eternal home.</div></div></div></div><div><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 id="bb93485" class="text-center em:leading-5 em:text-3xl em:mt-3 em:mb-3"><a href="/en/library/iso/2/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline">Mantra Two</a></h2></div><div class="av-verse_text"><h3 class="text-center em:leading-5 em:text-xl font-bold em:mb-4 hidden">Verse text</h3><div id="bb93486" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic"><em>kurvann eveha karmāṇi<br />jijīviṣec chataḿ samāḥ<br />evaṁ tvayi nānyatheto ’sti<br />na karma lipyate nare</em></div></div></div><div class="av-synonyms"><h3 class="text-center em:leading-5 em:text-xl font-bold em:mb-4">Synonyms</h3><div id="bb93487" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-justify"><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=kurvan" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>kurvan</em></a> — <span class="inline">doing continuously</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=eva" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>eva</em></a> — <span class="inline">thus</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=iha" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>iha</em></a> — <span class="inline">during this span of life</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=karmāṇi" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>karmāṇi</em></a> — <span class="inline">work</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=jijīviṣet" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>jijīviṣet</em></a> — <span class="inline">one should desire to live</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=śatam" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>śatam</em></a> — <span class="inline">one hundred</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=samāḥ" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>samāḥ</em></a> — <span class="inline">years</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=evam" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>evam</em></a> — <span class="inline">so living</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=tvayi" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>tvayi</em></a> — <span class="inline">unto you</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=na" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>na</em></a> — <span class="inline">no</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=anyathā" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>anyathā</em></a> — <span class="inline">alternative</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=itaḥ" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>itaḥ</em></a> — <span class="inline">from this path</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=asti" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>asti</em></a> — <span class="inline">there is</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=na" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>na</em></a> — <span class="inline">not</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=karma" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>karma</em></a> — <span class="inline">work</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=lipyate" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>lipyate</em></a> — <span class="inline">can be bound</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=nare" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>nare</em></a> — <span class="inline">unto a man</span>.</span></div></div></div><div class="av-translation"><h3 class="text-center em:leading-5 em:text-xl font-bold em:mb-4">Translation</h3><div id="bb93488" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>One may aspire to live for hundreds of years if he continuously goes on working in that way, for that sort of work will not bind him to the law of karma.

This tendency is visible not only individually but also collectively in the community, society and nation. There is a hard struggle for life by all kinds of living entities, and the <em>Vedas</em> say that this is quite natural. The living being is eternal by nature, but due to his bondage in material existence he has to change his body over and over. This process is called transmigration of the soul or <em>karma-bandhana,</em> bondage by one’s work. The living entity has to work for his livelihood because that is the law of material nature, and if he does not act according to his prescribed duties, he transgresses the law of nature and binds himself more and more to the cycle of birth and death in the many species of life.</div></div><div id="bb93490" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Other life forms are also subject to the cycle of birth and death, but when the living entity attains a human life, he gets a chance to get free from the chains of <em>karma.

Ordinary men wish to perform good work in order to be recognized and achieve some higher status of life in this world or in heaven, but more advanced men want to be free altogether from the actions and reactions of work. Intelligent men well know that both good and bad work equally bind one to the material miseries. Consequently they seek that work which will free them from the reactions of both good and bad work. Such liberating work is described here in the pages of <em>Śrī Īśopaniṣad</em>.</div></div><div id="bb93491" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The instructions of <em>Śrī Īśopaniṣad</em> are more elaborately explained in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> sometimes called the <em>Gītopaniṣad,</em> the cream of all the <em>Upaniṣads.</em> In the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (3.9–16) the Personality of Godhead says that one cannot attain the state of <em>naiṣkarmya,</em> or <em>akarma,</em> without executing the prescribed duties mentioned in the Vedic literature. This literature can regulate the working energy of a human being in such a way that he can gradually realize the authority of the Supreme Being. When he realizes the authority of the Personality of Godhead – Vāsudeva, or Kṛṣṇa – it is to be understood that he has attained the stage of positive knowledge. In this purified stage the modes of nature – namely goodness, passion and ignorance – cannot act, and he is able to work on the basis of <em>naiṣkarmya.</em> Such work does not bind one to the cycle of birth and death.</div></div><div id="bb93492" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Factually, no one has to do anything more than render devotional service to the Lord. However, in the lower stages of life one cannot immediately adopt the activities of devotional service, nor can one completely stop fruitive work. A conditioned soul is accustomed to working for sense gratification – for his own selfish interest, immediate or extended. An ordinary man works for his own sense enjoyment, and when this principle of sense enjoyment is extended to include his society, nation or humanity in general, it assumes various attractive names such as altruism, socialism, communism, nationalism and humanitarianism. These “isms” are certainly very attractive forms of <em>karma-bandhana</em> (karmic bondage), but the Vedic instruction of <em>Śrī Īśopaniṣad</em> is that if one actually wants to live for any of the above “isms,” he should make them God-centered. There is no harm in becoming a family man, or an altruist, a socialist, a communist, a nationalist or a humanitarian, provided that one executes his activities in relation with <em>īśāvāsya,</em> the God-centered conception.</div></div><div id="bb93493" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <a href="/en/library/bg/2/40/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (2.40)</a> Lord Kṛṣṇa states that God-centered activities are so valuable that just a few of them can save a person from the greatest danger. The greatest danger of life is the danger of gliding down again into the evolutionary cycle of birth and death among the 8,400,000 species. If somehow or other a man misses the spiritual opportunity afforded by his human form of life and falls down again into the evolutionary cycle, he must be considered most unfortunate. Due to his defective senses, a foolish man cannot see that this is happening. Consequently <em>Śrī Īśopaniṣad</em> advises us to exert our energy in the spirit of <em>īśāvāsya.</em> Being so engaged, we may wish to live for many, many years; otherwise a long life in itself has no value. A tree lives for hundreds and hundreds of years, but there is no point in living a long time like trees, or breathing like bellows, or begetting children like hogs and dogs, or eating like camels. A humble God-centered life is more valuable than a colossal hoax of a life dedicated to godless altruism or socialism.</div></div><div id="bb93494" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">When altruistic activities are executed in the spirit of <em>Śrī Īśopaniṣad,</em> they become a form of <em>karma-yoga.</em> Such activities are recommended in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (18.5–9), for they guarantee their executor protection from the danger of sliding down into the evolutionary process of birth and death. Even though such God-centered activities may be half-finished, they are still good for the executor because they will guarantee him a human form in his next birth.

The Vedic scriptures and the <em>ācāryas,</em> or saintly teachers, are compared to expert boatmen, and the facilities of the human body are compared to favorable breezes that help the boat ply smoothly to its desired destination. If, with all these facilities, a human being does not fully utilize his life for self-realization, he must be considered <em>ātma-hā,</em> a killer of the soul. <em>Śrī Īśopaniṣad</em> warns in clear terms that the killer of the soul is destined to enter into the darkest region of ignorance to suffer perpetually.</div></div><div id="bb93502" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">There are swine, dogs, camels, asses, etc., whose economic necessities are just as important to them as ours are to us, but the economic problems of these animals are solved only under nasty and unpleasant conditions. The human being is given all facilities for a comfortable life by the laws of nature because the human form of life is more important and valuable than animal life. Why is man given a better life than that of the swine and other animals? Why is a highly placed government servant given better facilities than those of an ordinary clerk? The answer is that a highly placed officer has to discharge duties of a higher nature. Similarly, the duties human beings have to perform are higher than those of animals, who are always engaged in simply feeding their hungry stomachs. Yet the modern soul-killing civilization has only increased the problems of the hungry stomach. When we approach a polished animal in the form of a modern civilized man and ask him to take interest in self-realization, he will say that he simply wants to work to satisfy his stomach and that there is no need of self-realization for a hungry man. The laws of nature are so cruel, however, that despite his denunciation of the need for self-realization and his eagerness to work hard to fill his stomach, he is always threatened by unemployment.</div></div><div id="bb93503" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">We are given this human form of life not to work hard like asses, swine and dogs but to attain the highest perfection of life.

Some of the regions where the <em>asuras</em> are sent to work are revealed in this <em>mantra</em> of <em>Śrī Īśopaniṣad.</em> If a man fails to discharge his duties as a human being, he is forced to transmigrate to the <em>asurya</em> planets and take birth in degraded species of life to work hard in ignorance and darkness.</div></div><div id="bb93504" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (6.41–43) it is stated that a man who enters upon the path of self-realization but does not complete the process, despite having sincerely tried to realize his relationship with God, is given a chance to appear in a family of <em>śuci</em> or <em>śrīmat.</em> The word <em>śuci</em> indicates a spiritually advanced <em>brāhmaṇa,</em> and <em>śrīmat</em> indicates a <em>vaiśya,</em> a member of the mercantile community. So the person who fails to achieve self-realization is given a better chance in his next life due to his sincere efforts in this life. If even a fallen candidate is given a chance to take birth in a respectable and noble family, one can hardly imagine the status of one who has achieved success. By simply attempting to realize God, one is guaranteed birth in a wealthy or aristocratic family. But those who do not even make an attempt, who want to be covered by illusion, who are too materialistic and too attached to material enjoyment, must enter into the darkest regions of hell, as confirmed throughout the Vedic literature. Such materialistic <em>asuras</em> sometimes make a show of religion, but their ultimate aim is material prosperity. The <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (16.17–18) rebukes such men by calling them <em>ātma-sambhāvita,</em> meaning that they are considered great only on the strength of deception and are empowered by the votes of the ignorant and by their own material wealth.

He can be known only by His devotees through His mercy. In the <em>Brahma-saṁhitā</em> (5.34) it is stated that even if a nondevotee philosopher travels through space at the speed of the wind or the mind for hundreds of millions of years, he will still find that the Absolute Truth is far, far away from him. The <em>Brahma-saṁhitā</em> (5.37) further describes that the Absolute Personality of Godhead has His transcendental abode, known as Goloka, where He remains and engages in His pastimes, yet by His inconceivable potencies He can simultaneously reach every part of His creative energy. In the <em>Viṣṇu Purāṇa</em> His potencies are compared to the heat and light that emanate from a fire. Although situated in one place, a fire can distribute its light and heat for some distance; similarly, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, although fixed in His transcendental abode, can diffuse His different energies everywhere.</div></div><div id="bb93511" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Although His energies are innumerable, they can be divided into three principal categories: the internal potency, the marginal potency and the external potency. There are hundreds and millions of subheadings to each of these categories. The dominating demigods who are empowered to control and administer such natural phenomena as air, light and rain are all classified within the marginal potency of the Absolute Person. Lesser living beings, including humans, also belong to the Lord’s marginal potency. The material world is the creation of the Lord’s external potency.

Although the Lord and His energies are nondifferent, one should not mistake these energies for the Supreme Truth. Nor should one wrongly consider that the Supreme Lord is distributed everywhere impersonally or that He loses His personal existence. Men are accustomed to reaching conclusions according to their capacity for understanding, but the Supreme Lord is not subject to our limited capacity for understanding. It is for this reason that the <em>Upaniṣads</em> warn us that no one can approach the Lord by his own limited potency.</div></div><div id="bb93513" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <a href="/en/library/bg/10/2/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (10.2)</a> the Lord says that not even the great <em>ṛṣis</em> and <em>suras</em> can know Him. And what to speak of the <em>asuras,</em> for whom there is no question of understanding the ways of the Lord? This fourth <em>mantra</em> of <em>Śrī Īśopaniṣad</em> very clearly suggests that the Absolute Truth is ultimately the Absolute Person; otherwise there would have been no need to mention so many details in support of His personal features.</div></div><div id="bb93514" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Although the individual parts and parcels of the Lord’s potencies have all the symptoms of the Lord Himself, they have limited spheres of activity and are therefore all limited. The parts and parcels are never equal to the whole; therefore they cannot appreciate the Lord’s full potency. Under the influence of material nature, foolish and ignorant living beings who are but parts and parcels of the Lord try to conjecture about the Lord’s transcendental position. <em>Śrī Īśopaniṣad</em> warns of the futility of trying to establish the identity of the Lord through mental speculation. One should try to learn of the Transcendence from the Lord Himself, the supreme source of the <em>Vedas,</em> for the Lord alone has full knowledge of the Transcendence.</div></div><div id="bb93515" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Every part and parcel of the Complete Whole is endowed with some particular energy to act according to the Lord’s will.

Thus from the very beginning <em>Śrī Īśopaniṣad</em> warns us to be very careful to play the part designated for us by the Lord. This does not mean that the individual soul has no initiative of his own. Because he is part and parcel of the Lord, he must partake of the initiative of the Lord as well. When a person properly utilizes his initiative, or active nature, with intelligence, understanding that everything is the Lord’s potency, he can revive his original consciousness, which was lost due to association with <em>māyā,</em> the external energy.</div></div><div id="bb93516" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">All power is obtained from the Lord; therefore each particular power must be utilized to execute the will of the Lord and not otherwise.

The contradictions given here prove the inconceivable potencies of the Lord. “He walks, and He does not walk.” Ordinarily, if someone can walk, it is illogical to say he cannot walk. But in reference to God, such a contradiction simply serves to indicate His inconceivable power. With our limited fund of knowledge we cannot accommodate such contradictions, and therefore we conceive of the Lord in terms of our limited powers of understanding. For example, the impersonalist philosophers of the Māyāvāda school accept only the Lord’s impersonal activities and reject His personal feature. But the members of the Bhāgavata school, adopting the perfect conception of the Lord, accept His inconceivable potencies and thus understand that He is both personal and impersonal. The <em>bhāgavatas</em> know that without inconceivable potencies there can be no meaning to the words “Supreme Lord.”</div></div><div id="bb93522" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">We should not take it for granted that because we cannot see God with our eyes the Lord has no personal existence. <em>Śrī Īśopaniṣad</em> refutes this argument by declaring that the Lord is far away but very near also. The abode of the Lord is beyond the material sky, and we have no means to measure even this material sky. If the material sky extends so far, then what to speak of the spiritual sky, which is altogether beyond it? That the spiritual sky is situated far, far away from the material universe is confirmed in the <a href="/en/library/bg/15/6/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (15.6)</a>. But despite the Lord’s being so far away, He can at once, within less than a second, descend before us with a speed swifter than that of the mind or wind. He can also run so swiftly that no one can surpass Him. This has already been described in the previous <em>mantra.</em></div></div><div id="bb93523" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Yet when the Personality of Godhead comes before us, we neglect Him. Such foolish negligence is condemned by the Lord in the <a href="/en/library/bg/9/11/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (9.11)</a>, where He says that the foolish deride Him, considering Him a mortal being. He is not a mortal being, nor does He come before us with a body produced of material nature. There are many so-called scholars who contend that the Lord descends in a body made of matter, just like an ordinary living being. Not knowing His inconceivable power, such foolish men place the Lord on an equal level with ordinary men.</div></div><div id="bb93524" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Because He is full of inconceivable potencies, God can accept our service through any sort of medium, and He can convert His different potencies according to His own will. Nonbelievers argue either that the Lord cannot incarnate Himself at all, or that if He does He descends in a form of material energy. These arguments are nullified if we accept the existence of the Lord’s inconceivable potencies. Then we will understand that even if the Lord appears before us in the form of material energy, it is quite possible for Him to convert this energy into spiritual energy. Since the source of the energies is one and the same, the energies can be utilized according to the will of their source. For example, the Lord can appear in the form of the <em>arcā-vigraha,</em> a Deity supposedly made of earth, stone or wood. Deity forms, although engraved from wood, stone or other matter, are not idols, as the iconoclasts contend.</div></div><div id="bb93525" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In our present state of imperfect material existence, we cannot see the Supreme Lord due to imperfect vision. Yet those devotees who want to see Him by means of material vision are favored by the Lord, who appears in a so-called material form to accept His devotees’ service. One should not think that such devotees, who are in the lowest stage of devotional service, are worshiping an idol. They are factually worshiping the Lord, who has agreed to appear before them in an approachable way. Nor is the <em>arcā</em> form fashioned according to the whims of the worshiper. This form is eternally existent with all paraphernalia. This can be actually felt by a sincere devotee, but not by an atheist.</div></div><div id="bb93526" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <a href="/en/library/bg/4/11/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (4.11)</a> the Lord says that how He treats His devotee depends on the devotee’s degree of surrender. The Lord reserves the right not to reveal Himself to anyone and everyone but to show Himself only to those souls who surrender unto Him. Thus for the surrendered soul He is always within reach, whereas for the unsurrendered soul He is far, far away and cannot be approached.</div></div><div id="bb93527" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In this connection, two words the revealed scriptures often apply to the Lord – <em>saguṇa</em> (“with qualities”) and <em>nirguṇa</em> (“without qualities”) – are very important. The word <em>saguṇa</em> does not imply that when the Lord appears with perceivable qualities He must take on a material form and be subject to the laws of material nature. For Him there is no difference between the material and spiritual energies, because He is the source of all energies. As the controller of all energies, He cannot at any time be under their influence, as we are. The material energy works according to His direction; therefore He can use that energy for His purposes without ever being influenced by any of the qualities of that energy. (In this sense He is <em>nirguṇa,</em> “without qualities.”) Nor does the Lord become a formless entity at any time, for ultimately He is the eternal form, the primeval Lord. His impersonal aspect, or Brahman effulgence, is but the glow of His personal rays, just as the sun’s rays are the glow of the sun-god.</div></div><div id="bb93528" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">When the child saint Prahlāda Mahārāja was in the presence of his atheist father, his father asked him, “Where is your God?” When Prahlāda replied that God resides everywhere, the father angrily asked whether his God was within one of the pillars of the palace, and the child said yes. At once the atheist king shattered the pillar in front of him to pieces, and the Lord instantly appeared as Nṛsiṁha, the half-man, half-lion incarnation, and killed the atheist king. Thus the Lord is within everything, and He creates everything by His different energies. Through His inconceivable powers He can appear at any place in order to favor His sincere devotee. Lord Nṛsiṁha appeared from within the pillar not by the order of the atheist king but by the wish of His devotee Prahlāda. An atheist cannot order the Lord to appear, but the Lord will appear anywhere and everywhere to show mercy to His devotee. The <a href="/en/library/bg/4/8/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (4.8)</a> similarly states that the Lord appears in order to vanquish nonbelievers and protect believers. Of course, the Lord has sufficient energies and agents who can vanquish atheists, but it pleases Him to personally favor a devotee. Therefore He descends as an incarnation. Actually, He descends only to favor His devotees and not for any other purpose.</div></div><div id="bb93529" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <em>Brahma-saṁhitā</em> (5.35) it is said that Govinda, the primeval Lord, enters everything by His plenary portion.

Devotees in this stage consider the Lord to be present at the place of worship and nowhere else. They cannot ascertain who is in what position in devotional service, nor can they tell who has realized the Supreme Lord.

The <em>madhyama-adhikārī</em> behaves differently toward these four classes of person. He adores the Lord, considering Him the object of love; he makes friends with those who are in devotional service; he tries to awaken the dormant love of God in the hearts of the innocent; and he avoids the atheists, who deride the very name of the Lord.</div></div><div id="bb93537" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Above the <em>madhyama-adhikārī</em> is the <em>uttama-adhikārī,</em> who sees everything in relation to the Supreme Lord.

He knows that there is no essential difference between a vastly learned <em>brāhmaṇa</em> and a dog in the street, because both of them are part and parcel of the Lord, although they are encaged in different bodies on account of the different qualities of their activities in their previous lives. He sees that the <em>brāhmaṇa</em> particle of the Supreme Lord has not misused his little independence given him by the Lord and that the dog particle has misused his independence and is therefore being punished by the laws of nature by being encaged in the form of a dog. Not considering the respective actions of the <em>brāhmaṇa</em> and the dog, the <em>uttama-adhikārī</em> tries to do good to both. Such a learned devotee is not misled by material bodies but is attracted by the spiritual spark within them.</div></div><div id="bb93538" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Those who imitate an <em>uttama-adhikārī</em> by flaunting a sense of oneness or fellowship but who behave on the bodily platform are actually false philanthropists.

One cannot see properly unless one has heard from a superior source, and the highest source is the Vedic wisdom, which is spoken by the Lord Himself. Vedic truths are coming in disciplic succession from the Lord to Brahmā, from Brahmā to Nārada, from Nārada to Vyāsa, and from Vyāsa to his many disciples.

One who imitates the symptoms of an <em>uttama-adhikārī</em> may serve another’s outward body for the purpose of fame or material reward, but he does not serve the spirit soul.

The living entities are qualitatively one with the Supreme Lord, just as the sparks of a fire are qualitatively one with the fire. Yet sparks are not fire as far as quantity is concerned, for the quantity of heat and light present in the sparks is not equal to that in fire. The <em>mahā-bhāgavata,</em> the great devotee, sees oneness in the sense that he sees everything as the energy of the Supreme Lord. Since there is no difference between the energy and the energetic, there is the sense of oneness. Although from the analytical point of view heat and light are different from fire, there is no meaning to the word “fire” without heat and light. In synthesis, therefore, heat, light and fire are the same.</div></div><div id="bb93547" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In this <em>mantra</em> the words <em>ekatvam anupaśyataḥ</em> indicate that one should see the unity of all living entities from the viewpoint of the revealed scriptures. The individual sparks of the supreme whole (the Lord) possess almost eighty percent of the known qualities of the whole, but they are not quantitatively equal to the Supreme Lord. These qualities are present in minute quantity, for the living entity is but a minute part and parcel of the supreme whole. To use another example, the quantity of salt present in a drop is never comparable to the quantity of salt present in the complete ocean, but the salt present in the drop is qualitatively equal in chemical composition to all the salt present in the ocean. If the individual living being were equal to the Supreme Lord both qualitatively and quantitatively, there would be no question of his being under the influence of the material energy. In the previous <em>mantras</em> it has already been discussed that no living being – not even the powerful demigods – can surpass the Supreme Being in any respect. Therefore <em>ekatvam</em> does not mean that a living being is equal in all respects to the Supreme Lord. It does, however, indicate that in a broader sense there is one interest, just as in a family the interest of all members is one, or in a nation the national interest is one, although there are many different individual citizens. Since the living entities are all members of the same supreme family, their interest and that of the Supreme Being are not different. Every living being is the son of the Supreme Being. As stated in the <a href="/en/library/bg/7/5/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (7.5)</a>, all living creatures throughout the universe – including birds, reptiles, ants, aquatics, trees and so on – are emanations of the marginal potency of the Supreme Lord.

There is no clash of interest.</div></div><div id="bb93548" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The spiritual entities are meant for enjoyment, as stated in the <em>Vedānta-sūtra</em> (1.1.12): <em>ānanda-mayo ’bhyāsāt</em>. By nature and constitution, every living being – including the Supreme Lord and each of His parts and parcels – is meant for eternal enjoyment. The living beings who are encaged in the material tabernacle are constantly seeking enjoyment, but they are seeking it on the wrong platform. Apart from the material platform is the spiritual platform, where the Supreme Being enjoys Himself with His innumerable associates. On that platform there is no trace of material qualities, and therefore that platform is called <em>nirguṇa.</em> On the <em>nirguṇa</em> platform there is never a clash over the object of enjoyment. Here in the material world there is always a clash between different individual beings because here the proper center of enjoyment is missed. The real center of enjoyment is the Supreme Lord, who is the center of the sublime and spiritual <em>rāsa</em> dance. We are all meant to join Him and enjoy life with one transcendental interest and without any clash. That is the highest platform of spiritual interest, and as soon as one realizes this perfect form of oneness, there can be no question of illusion (<em>moha</em>) or lamentation (<em>śoka</em>).</div></div><div id="bb93549" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">A godless civilization arises from illusion, and the result of such a civilization is lamentation.

The supreme <em>ātmā,</em> or soul, is the Lord Himself, and the minute <em>ātmā</em> is the living entity. The supreme <em>ātmā,</em> or Paramātmā, alone maintains all the individual minute beings, for the Supreme Lord wants to derive pleasure out of their affection. The father extends himself through his children and maintains them in order to derive pleasure. If the children obey the father’s will, family affairs will run smoothly, with one interest and a pleasing atmosphere. The same situation is transcendentally arranged in the absolute family of the Para-brahman, the Supreme Spirit.</div></div><div id="bb93551" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The Para-brahman is as much a person as the individual entities.

But such a <em>mahātmā,</em> or great soul, is very rarely seen because such transcendental realization is achieved only after many, many births. Once it is attained, however, there is no longer any illusion or lamentation or the miseries of material existence or birth and death, which are all experienced in our present life.

The forms of the living entities in this world are embodied in material nature, and they work like any material machine. The anatomy of a material body must have a mechanical construction with veins and so forth, but the transcendental body of the Supreme Lord has nothing like veins. It is clearly stated here that He is unembodied, which means that there is no difference between His body and His soul. Nor is He forced to accept a body according to the laws of nature, as we are. In materially conditioned life, the soul is different from the gross embodiment and subtle mind. For the Supreme Lord, however, there is never any such difference between Him and His body and mind.

As such, He does not require a separate body or mind, as we do in material existence. The Vedic literature clearly states that the Lord’s transcendental body is completely different from ours; thus He is sometimes described as formless. This means that He has no form like ours and that He is devoid of a form we can conceive of. In the <em>Brahma-saṁhitā</em> (5.32) it is further stated that with each and every part of His body He can do the work of the other senses. This means that the Lord can walk with His hands, accept things with His legs, see with His hands and feet, eat with His eyes, etc. In the <em>śruti-mantras</em> it is also said that although the Lord has no hands and legs like ours, He has a different type of hands and legs, by which He can accept all that we offer Him and run faster than anyone.

The Lord’s original form is that of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and Śrī Kṛṣṇa expands Himself into an unlimited number of forms, such as Baladeva, Rāma, Nṛsiṁha and Varāha. All of these forms are one and the same Personality of Godhead. Similarly, the <em>arcā-vigraha</em> worshiped in temples is also an expanded form of the Lord. By worshiping the <em>arcā-vigraha,</em> one can at once approach the Lord, who accepts the service of a devotee by His omnipotent energy. The <em>arcā-vigraha</em> of the Lord descends at the request of the <em>ācāryas,</em> the holy teachers, and works exactly in the original way of the Lord by virtue of the Lord’s omnipotence. Foolish people who have no knowledge of <em>Śrī Īśopaniṣad</em> or any of the other <em>śruti-mantras</em> consider the <em>arcā-vigraha,</em> which is worshiped by pure devotees, to be made of material elements. This form may be seen as material by the imperfect eyes of foolish people or <em>kaniṣṭha-adhikārīs,</em> but such people do not know that the Lord, being omnipotent and omniscient, can transform matter into spirit and spirit into matter, as He desires.</div></div><div id="bb93559" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (9.11–12) the Lord regrets the fallen condition of men with little knowledge who deride Him because He descends like a man into this world.

He can be appreciated only in proportion to one’s surrender to Him.

If a man wants to be a high-court judge, he must acquire not only the necessary qualifications but also the consent of the authority who can award the title of high-court judge. The qualifications in themselves are insufficient for one to occupy the post: it must be awarded by some superior authority.

Unfortunately, living beings under the influence of material nature ask for many other things, and they are described in the <a href="/en/library/bg/2/41/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (2.41)</a> as having divided, or splayed, intelligence. Spiritual intelligence is one, but mundane intelligence is diverse. In <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> (7.5.30–31) it is stated that those who are captivated by the temporary beauties of the external energy forget the real aim of life, which is to go back to Godhead. Forgetting this, one tries to adjust things by various plans and programs, but this is like chewing what has already been chewed. Nonetheless, the Lord is so kind that He allows the forgetful living entity to continue in this way without interference. Thus this <em>mantra</em> of <em>Śrī Īśopaniṣad</em> uses the very appropriate word <em>yāthātathyataḥ,</em> indicating that the Lord rewards the living entities just in pursuance of their desires. If a living being wants to go to hell, the Lord allows him to do so without interference, and if he wants to go back home, back to Godhead, the Lord helps him.</div></div><div id="bb93562" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">God is described here as <em>paribhūḥ,</em> the greatest of all. No one is greater than or equal to Him. Other living beings are described here as beggars who ask goods from the Lord. The Lord supplies the things the living entities desire. If the entities were equal to the Lord in potency – if they were omnipotent and omniscient – there would be no question of their begging from the Lord, even for so-called liberation. Real liberation means going back to Godhead. Liberation as conceived of by an impersonalist is a myth, and begging for sense gratification has to continue eternally unless the beggar comes to his spiritual senses and realizes his constitutional position.</div></div><div id="bb93563" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Only the Supreme Lord is self-sufficient. When Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared on earth five thousand years ago, He displayed His full manifestation as the Personality of Godhead through His various activities. In His childhood He killed many powerful demons, such as Aghāsura, Bakāsura and Śakaṭāsura, and there was no question of His having acquired such power through any extraneous endeavor. He lifted Govardhana Hill without ever practicing weight-lifting. He danced with the <em>gopīs</em> without social restriction and without reproach. Although the <em>gopīs</em> approached Him with a paramour’s feelings of love, the relationship between the <em>gopīs</em> and Lord Kṛṣṇa was worshiped even by Lord Caitanya, who was a strict <em>sannyāsī</em> and rigid follower of disciplinary regulations. To confirm that the Lord is always pure and uncontaminated, <em>Śrī Īśopaniṣad</em> describes Him as <em>śuddham</em> (antiseptic) and <em>apāpa-viddham</em> (prophylactic). He is antiseptic in the sense that even an impure thing can become purified just by touching Him. The word “prophylactic” refers to the power of His association. As mentioned in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (9.30–31), a devotee may appear to be <em>su-durācāra,</em> not well behaved, in the beginning, but he should be accepted as pure because he is on the right path. This is due to the prophylactic nature of the Lord’s association. The Lord is also <em>apāpa-viddham</em> because sin cannot touch Him. Even if He acts in a way that appears to be sinful, such actions are all-good, for there is no question of His being affected by sin. Because in all circumstances He is <em>śuddham,</em> most purified, He is often compared to the sun. The sun extracts moisture from many untouchable places on the earth, yet it remains pure. In fact, it purifies obnoxious things by virtue of its sterilizing powers. If the sun, which is a material object, is so powerful, then we can hardly begin to imagine the purifying strength of the all-powerful Lord.</div></div></div></div><div><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 id="bb93564" class="text-center em:leading-5 em:text-3xl em:mt-3 em:mb-3"><a href="/en/library/iso/9/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline">Mantra Nine</a></h2></div><div class="av-verse_text"><h3 class="text-center em:leading-5 em:text-xl font-bold em:mb-4 hidden">Verse text</h3><div id="bb93565" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic"><em>andhaṁ tamaḥ praviśanti<br />ye ’vidyām upāsate<br />tato bhūya iva te tamo<br />ya u vidyāyāḿ ratāḥ</em></div></div></div><div class="av-synonyms"><h3 class="text-center em:leading-5 em:text-xl font-bold em:mb-4">Synonyms</h3><div id="bb93566" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-justify"><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=andham" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>andham</em></a> — <span class="inline">gross ignorance</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=tamaḥ" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>tamaḥ</em></a> — <span class="inline">darkness</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=praviśanti" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>praviśanti</em></a> — <span class="inline">enter into</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=ye" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>ye</em></a> — <span class="inline">those who</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=avidyām" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>avidyām</em></a> — <span class="inline">nescience</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=upāsate" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>upāsate</em></a> — <span class="inline">worship</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=tataḥ" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>tataḥ</em></a> — <span class="inline">than that</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=bhūyaḥ" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>bhūyaḥ</em></a> — <span class="inline">still more</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=iva" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>iva</em></a> — <span class="inline">like</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=te" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>te</em></a> — <span class="inline">they</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=tamaḥ" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>tamaḥ</em></a> — <span class="inline">darkness</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=ye" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>ye</em></a> — <span class="inline">those who</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=u" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>u</em></a> — <span class="inline">also</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=vidyāyām" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>vidyāyām</em></a> — <span class="inline">in the culture of knowledge</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=ratāḥ" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>ratāḥ</em></a> — <span class="inline">engaged</span>.</span></div></div></div><div class="av-translation"><h3 class="text-center em:leading-5 em:text-xl font-bold em:mb-4">Translation</h3><div id="bb93567" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Those who engage in the culture of nescient activities shall enter into the darkest region of ignorance.

Avidyā,</em> or ignorance, is undoubtedly dangerous, but <em>vidyā,</em> or knowledge, is even more dangerous when mistaken or misguided. This <em>mantra</em> of <em>Śrī Īśopaniṣad</em> is more applicable today than at any time in the past. Modern civilization has advanced considerably in the field of mass education, but the result is that people are more unhappy than ever before because of the stress placed on material advancement to the exclusion of the most important part of life, the spiritual aspect.</div></div><div id="bb93569" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">As far as <em>vidyā</em> is concerned, the first <em>mantra</em> has explained very clearly that the Supreme Lord is the proprietor of everything and that forgetfulness of this fact is ignorance. The more a man forgets this fact of life, the more he is in darkness. In view of this, a godless civilization directed toward the so-called advancement of education is more dangerous than a civilization in which the masses of people are less “educated.”</div></div><div id="bb93570" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Of the different classes of men – <em>karmīs, jñānīs</em> and <em>yogīs</em> – the <em>karmīs</em> are those who are engaged in the activities of sense gratification. In the modern civilization, 99.9 percent of the people are engaged in the activities of sense gratification under the flags of industrialism, economic development, altruism, political activism, and so on. All these activities are more or less based on satisfaction of the senses, to the exclusion of the kind of God consciousness described in the first <em>mantra</em>.</div></div><div id="bb93571" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the language of the <a href="/en/library/bg/7/15/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (7.15)</a>, people who are engaged in gross sense gratification are <em>mūḍhas</em> – asses. The ass is a symbol of stupidity. Those who simply engage in the profitless pursuit of sense gratification are worshiping <em>avidyā,</em> according to <em>Śrī Īśopaniṣad.</em> And those who play the role of helping this sort of civilization in the name of educational advancement are actually doing more harm than those who are on the platform of gross sense gratification. The advancement of learning by a godless people is as dangerous as a valuable jewel on the hood of a cobra. A cobra decorated with a valuable jewel is more dangerous than one not decorated. In the <em>Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya</em> (3.11.12), the advancement of education by a godless people is compared to decorations on a dead body. In India, as in many other countries, some people follow the custom of leading a procession with a decorated dead body for the pleasure of the lamenting relatives. In the same way, modern civilization is a patchwork of activities meant to cover the perpetual miseries of material existence. All such activities are aimed toward sense gratification. But above the senses is the mind, and above the mind is the intelligence, and above the intelligence is the soul. Thus the aim of real education should be self-realization, realization of the spiritual values of the soul. Any education which does not lead to such realization must be considered <em>avidyā,</em> or nescience. And to culture such nescience means to go down to the darkest region of ignorance.</div></div><div id="bb93572" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">According to the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (2.42, 7.15), mistaken mundane educators are known as <em>veda-vāda-rata</em> and <em>māyayāpahṛta-jñāna.</em> They may also be atheistic demons, the lowest of men. Those who are <em>veda-vāda-rata</em> pose themselves as very learned in the Vedic literature, but unfortunately they are completely diverted from the purpose of the <em>Vedas.</em> In the <a href="/en/library/bg/15/15/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (15.15)</a> it is said that the purpose of the <em>Vedas</em> is to know the Personality of Godhead, but these <em>veda-vāda-rata</em> men are not at all interested in the Personality of Godhead.

Sometimes they even condemn the <em>Purāṇas,</em> which are authentic Vedic explanations for laymen. The <em>veda-vāda-ratas</em> give their own explanations of the <em>Vedas,</em> neglecting the authority of great teachers (<em>ācāryas</em>). They also tend to raise some unscrupulous person from among themselves and present him as the leading exponent of Vedic knowledge. Such <em>veda-vāda-ratas</em> are especially condemned in this <em>mantra</em> by the very appropriate Sanskrit words <em>vidyāyāṁ ratāḥ. Vidyāyām</em> refers to the study of the <em>Vedas</em> because the <em>Vedas</em> are the origin of all knowledge (<em>vidyā</em>), and <em>ratāḥ</em> means “those engaged.” <em>Vidyāyāṁ ratāḥ</em> thus means “those engaged in the study of the <em>Vedas.</em>” The so-called students of the <em>Vedas</em> are condemned herein because they are ignorant of the actual purpose of the <em>Vedas</em> on account of their disobeying the <em>ācāryas.</em> Such <em>veda-vāda-ratas</em> search out meanings in every word of the <em>Vedas</em> to suit their own purposes.

Some materialistic politicians in spiritual guise decry the present system of civilization as satanic, but unfortunately they do not care about the culture of real knowledge as it is described in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> Thus they cannot change the satanic situation.</div></div><div id="bb93601" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the modern society, even a boy thinks himself self-sufficient and pays no respect to elderly men. Due to the wrong type of education being imparted in our universities, boys all over the world are giving their elders headaches. Thus <em>Śrī Īśopaniṣad</em> very strongly warns that the culture of nescience is different from that of knowledge. The universities are, so to speak, centers of nescience only; consequently scientists are busy discovering lethal weapons to wipe out the existence of other countries. University students today are not given instructions in the regulative principles of <em>brahmacarya</em> (celibate student life), nor do they have any faith in any scriptural injunctions. Religious principles are taught for the sake of name and fame only and not for the sake of practical action.

No one considers that this tiny earth is just a lump of matter floating in immeasurable space along with many other lumps. In comparison to the vastness of space, these material lumps are like dust particles in the air. Because God has kindly made these lumps of matter complete in themselves, they are perfectly equipped with all necessities for floating in space.

The span of human life is scheduled for about a hundred years, although it is gradually decreasing to twenty or thirty years. Thanks to the culture of nescience, befooled men have created their own nations within these planets in order to grasp sense enjoyment more effectively for these few years. Such foolish people draw up various plans to render national demarcations perfectly, a task that is totally impossible. Yet for this purpose each and every nation has become a source of anxiety for others. More than fifty percent of a nation’s energy is devoted to defense measures and thus spoiled.

No one can be undisturbed unless he is perfectly spiritually realized, at which time one neither hankers nor laments for anything. A <em>dhīra</em> realizes that the material body and mind he has acquired by chance through material association are but foreign elements; therefore he simply makes the best use of a bad bargain.</div></div><div id="bb93605" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The material body and mind are bad bargains for the spiritual living entity.

Arjuna, for example, became a <em>dhīra</em> by submissively hearing from Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead Himself. Thus the perfect disciple must be like Arjuna, and the spiritual master must be as good as the Lord Himself.

He forced the creator of the universe, the demigod Brahmā, to come down to him. He then asked Brahmā for the benediction of becoming <em>amara,</em> by which one does not die. Brahmā said that he could not award the benediction because even he, the material creator who rules all planets, is not <em>amara.</em> As confirmed in the <a href="/en/library/bg/8/17/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (8.17)</a>, Brahmā lives a long time, but that does not mean he is immortal.</div></div><div id="bb93614" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><em>Hiraṇya</em> means “gold,” and <em>kaśipu</em> means “soft bed.” This cunning gentleman Hiraṇyakaśipu was interested in these two things – money and women – and he wanted to enjoy them by becoming immortal.

Since Brahmā told him that he could not grant the gift of immortality, Hiraṇyakaśipu requested that he not be killed by any man, animal, god or any other living being within the 8,400,000 species. He also asked that he not die on land, in the air or water, or by any weapon. In this way Hiraṇyakaśipu foolishly thought these guarantees would save him from death. Ultimately, however, although Brahmā granted him all these benedictions, he was killed by the Personality of Godhead in the form of Nṛsiṁha, the Lord’s half-lion, half-man incarnation, and no weapon was used to kill him, for he was killed by the Lord’s nails.

The conditioned living being has forgotten his eternal relationship with God and has mistakenly accepted the temporary place of his birth as all in all. The Lord has kindly delivered the above-mentioned scriptures in India and other scriptures in other countries to remind the forgetful human being that his home is not here in this material world. The living being is a spiritual entity, and he can be happy only by returning to his spiritual home.</div></div><div id="bb93618" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">From His kingdom the Personality of Godhead sends His bona fide servants to propagate this message by which one can return to Godhead, and sometimes the Lord comes Himself to do this work. Since all living beings are His beloved sons, His parts and parcels, God is more sorry than we ourselves to see the sufferings we are constantly undergoing in this material condition. The miseries of this material world serve to indirectly remind us of our incompatibility with dead matter. Intelligent living entities generally take note of these reminders and engage themselves in the culture of <em>vidyā,</em> or transcendental knowledge. Human life is the best opportunity for the culture of spiritual knowledge, and a human being who does not take advantage of this opportunity is called a <em>narādhama,</em> the lowest of human beings.</div></div><div id="bb93619" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The path of <em>avidyā,</em> or advancement of material knowledge for sense gratification, is the path of repeated birth and death. As he exists spiritually, the living entity has no birth or death. Birth and death apply to the outward covering of the spirit soul, the body. Death is compared to the taking off and birth to the putting on of outward garments. Foolish human beings who are grossly absorbed in the culture of <em>avidyā,</em> nescience, do not mind this cruel process. Enamored with the beauty of the illusory energy, they undergo the same miseries repeatedly and do not learn any lessons from the laws of nature.</div></div><div id="bb93620" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Therefore the culture of <em>vidyā,</em> or transcendental knowledge, is essential for the human being. Sense enjoyment in the diseased material condition must be restricted as far as possible. Unrestricted sense enjoyment in this bodily condition is the path of ignorance and death. The living entities are not without spiritual senses; every living being in his original, spiritual form has all the senses, which are now materially manifested, being covered by the material body and mind. The activities of the material senses are perverted reflections of the activities of the original, spiritual senses. In his diseased condition, the spirit soul engages in material activities under the material covering. Real sense enjoyment is possible only when the disease of materialism is removed. In our pure spiritual form, free from all material contamination, real enjoyment of the senses is possible. A patient must regain his health before he can truly enjoy sense pleasure again. Thus the aim of human life should not be to enjoy perverted sense enjoyment but to cure the material disease. Aggravation of the material disease is no sign of knowledge, but a sign of <em>avidyā,</em> ignorance. For good health, a person should not increase his fever from 105 degrees to 107 degrees but should reduce his temperature to the normal 98.6. That should be the aim of human life. The modern trend of material civilization is to increase the temperature of the feverish material condition, which has reached the point of 107 degrees in the form of atomic energy. Meanwhile, the foolish politicians are crying that at any moment the world may go to hell. That is the result of the advancement of material knowledge and the neglect of the most important part of life, the culture of spiritual knowledge. <em>Śrī Īśopaniṣad</em> herein warns that we must not follow this dangerous path leading to death. On the contrary, we must develop the culture of spiritual knowledge so that we may become completely free from the cruel hands of death.</div></div><div id="bb93621" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">This does not mean that all activities for the maintenance of the body should be stopped. There is no question of stopping activities, just as there is no question of wiping out one’s temperature altogether when trying to recover from a disease. “To make the best use of a bad bargain” is the appropriate expression. The culture of spiritual knowledge necessitates the help of the body and mind; therefore maintenance of the body and mind is required if we are to reach our goal. The normal temperature should be maintained at 98.6 degrees, and the great sages and saints of India have attempted to do this by a balanced program of spiritual and material knowledge.

Misguided men think that religion should be maintained because it contributes to economic development, which is required for sense gratification. Thus in order to guarantee further sense gratification after death, in heaven, there is some system of religious observance. But this is not the purpose of religion. The path of religion is actually meant for self-realization, and economic development is required just to maintain the body in a sound, healthy condition.

Although they are endowed with great powers, these powers are limited, and thus it is very difficult for them to know how Kṛṣṇa Himself appears by His own internal potency in the form of a man.</div></div><div id="bb93635" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Many philosophers and great <em>ṛṣis,</em> or mystics, try to distinguish the Absolute from the relative by their tiny brain power. This can only help them reach the negative conception of the Absolute without realizing any positive trace of the Absolute. Definition of the Absolute by negation is not complete. Such negative definitions lead one to create a concept of one’s own; thus one imagines that the Absolute must be formless and without qualities. Such negative qualities are simply the reversals of relative, material qualities and are therefore also relative. By conceiving of the Absolute in this way, one can at the utmost reach the impersonal effulgence of God, known as Brahman, but one cannot make further progress to Bhagavān, the Personality of Godhead.</div></div><div id="bb93636" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Such mental speculators do not know that the Absolute Personality of Godhead is Kṛṣṇa, that the impersonal Brahman is the glaring effulgence of His transcendental body, or that the Paramātmā, the Supersoul, is His all-pervading plenary representation. Nor do they know that Kṛṣṇa has His eternal form with its transcendental qualities of eternal bliss and knowledge. The dependent demigods and great sages imperfectly consider Him to be a powerful demigod, and they consider the Brahman effulgence to be the Absolute Truth. But the devotees of Kṛṣṇa, by dint of their surrendering unto Him and their unalloyed devotion, can know that He is the Absolute Person and that everything emanates from Him. Such devotees continuously render loving service unto Kṛṣṇa, the fountainhead of everything.</div></div><div id="bb93637" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (7.20, 23) it is said that only unintelligent, bewildered persons driven by a strong desire for sense gratification worship the demigods for the temporary relief of temporary problems. Since the living being is materially entangled, he has to be relieved from material bondage entirely to attain permanent relief on the spiritual plane, where eternal bliss, life and knowledge exist. <em>Śrī Īśopaniṣad</em> therefore instructs that we should not seek temporary relief of our difficulties by worshiping the dependent demigods, who can bestow only temporary benefit. Rather, we must worship the Absolute Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, who is all-attractive and who can bestow upon us complete freedom from material bondage by taking us back home, back to Godhead.</div></div><div id="bb93638" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">It is stated in the <a href="/en/library/bg/7/23/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (7.23)</a> that the worshipers of the demigods can go to the planets of the demigods. The moon worshipers can go to the moon, the sun worshipers to the sun, etc. Modern scientists are now venturing to the moon with the help of rockets, but this is not really a new attempt. With their advanced consciousness, human beings are naturally inclined to travel in outer space and to reach other planets, either by spaceships, mystic powers or demigod worship. In the Vedic scriptures it is said that one can reach other planets by any one of these three ways, but the most common way is by worshiping the demigod presiding over a particular planet. In this way one can reach the moon planet, the sun planet and even Brahmaloka, the topmost planet in this universe. However, all planets in the material universe are temporary residences; the only permanent planets are the Vaikuṇṭhalokas. These are found in the spiritual sky, where the Personality of Godhead Himself predominates.

The whole universe is covered by the gigantic material elements; it is just like a coconut covered by a shell and half-filled with water. Since its covering is airtight, the darkness within is dense, and therefore the sun and the moon are required for illumination. Outside the universe is the vast and unlimited <em>brahma-jyotir</em> expansion, which is filled with Vaikuṇṭha-lokas. The biggest and highest planet in the <em>brahma-jyotir</em> is Kṛṣṇaloka, or Goloka Vṛndāvana, where the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself, resides. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa never leaves Kṛṣṇaloka. Although He dwells there with His eternal associates, He is omnipresent throughout the complete material and spiritual cosmic manifestations. This fact has already been explained in Mantra Four. The Lord is present everywhere, just like the sun, yet He is situated in one place, just as the sun is situated in its own undeviating orbit.</div></div><div id="bb93642" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The problems of life cannot be solved simply by going to the moon planet or to some other planet above or below it.

There are many pseudo worshipers who become religionists only for the sake of name and fame. Such pseudo religionists do not wish to get out of this universe and reach the spiritual sky. They only want to maintain the status quo in the material world under the garb of worshiping the Lord. The atheists and impersonalists lead such foolish pseudo religionists into the darkest regions by preaching the cult of atheism. The atheist directly denies the existence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the impersonalists support the atheists by stressing the impersonal aspect of the Supreme Lord. Thus far we have not come across any <em>mantra</em> in <em>Śrī Īśopaniṣad</em> in which the Supreme Personality of Godhead is denied. It is said that He can run faster than anyone. Those who are running after other planets are certainly persons, and if the Lord can run faster than all of them, how can He be impersonal? The impersonal conception of the Supreme Lord is another form of ignorance, arising from an imperfect conception of the Absolute Truth.</div></div><div id="bb93643" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The ignorant pseudo religionists and the manufacturers of so-called incarnations who directly violate the Vedic injunctions are liable to enter into the darkest region of the universe because they mislead those who follow them.

If such foolish men have any knowledge at all, it is more dangerous in their hands than ignorance itself. Such impersonalists do not even worship the demigods according to the scriptural recommendations. In the scriptures there are recommendations for worshiping demigods under certain circumstances, but at the same time these scriptures state that there is normally no need for this. In the <a href="/en/library/bg/7/23/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (7.23)</a> it is clearly stated that the results derived from worshiping the demigods are not permanent.

In other words, the path of salvation from the material clutches fully depends on the principles of knowledge and detachment gained from serving the Lord. The pseudo religionists have neither knowledge nor detachment from material affairs, for most of them want to live in the golden shackles of material bondage under the shadow of philanthropic activities disguised as religious principles. By a false display of religious sentiments, they present a show of devotional service while indulging in all sorts of immoral activities. In this way they pass as spiritual masters and devotees of God. Such violators of religious principles have no respect for the authoritative <em>ācāryas,</em> the holy teachers in the strict disciplic succession. They ignore the Vedic injunction <em>ācāryopāsana</em> – “One must worship the <em>ācārya</em>” – and Kṛṣṇa’s statement in the <a href="/en/library/bg/4/2/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (4.2)</a> <em>evaṁ paramparā-prāptam,</em> “This supreme science of God is received through the disciplic succession.” Instead, to mislead the people in general they themselves become so-called <em>ācāryas,</em> but they do not even follow the principles of the <em>ācāryas</em>.</div></div><div id="bb93645" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">These rogues are the most dangerous elements in human society.

The words <em>sarvasya prabhavaḥ</em> indicate that Kṛṣṇa is the creator of everyone, including Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva. And because these three principal deities of the material world are created by the Lord, the Lord is the creator of all that exists in the material and spiritual worlds. In the <em>Atharva Veda</em> (<em>Gopāla-tāpanī Upaniṣad</em> 1.24) it is similarly said, “He who existed before the creation of Brahmā and who enlightened Brahmā with Vedic knowledge is Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa.” Similarly, the <em>Nārāyaṇa Upaniṣad</em> (1) states, “Then the Supreme Person, Nārāyaṇa, desired to create all living beings. Thus from Nārāyaṇa, Brahmā was born. Nārāyaṇa created all the Prajāpatis. Nārāyaṇa created Indra. Nārāyaṇa created the eight Vasus. Nārāyaṇa created the eleven Rudras. Nārāyaṇa created the twelve Ādityas.” Since Nārāyaṇa is a plenary manifestation of Lord Kṛṣṇa, Nārāyaṇa and Kṛṣṇa are one and the same. The <em>Nārāyaṇa Upaniṣad</em> (4) also states, “Devakī’s son [Kṛṣṇa] is the Supreme Lord.” The identity of Nārāyaṇa with the supreme cause has also been accepted and confirmed by Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya, even though Śaṅkara does not belong to the Vaiṣṇava, or personalist, cult. The <em>Atharva Veda</em> (<em>Mahā Upaniṣad</em> 1) also states, “Only Nārāyaṇa existed in the beginning, when neither Brahmā, nor Śiva, nor fire, nor water, nor stars, nor sun, nor moon existed. The Lord does not remain alone but creates as He desires.” Kṛṣṇa Himself states in the <em>Mokṣa-dharma,</em> “I created the Prajāpatis and the Rudras. They do not have complete knowledge of Me because they are covered by My illusory energy.” It is also stated in the <em>Varāha Purāṇa:</em> “Nārāyaṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and from Him the four-headed Brahmā was manifested, as well as Rudra, who later became omniscient.”</div></div><div id="bb93661" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Thus all Vedic literature confirms that Nārāyaṇa, or Kṛṣṇa, is the cause of all causes.

But when he became <em>budha</em> by hearing the Vedic knowledge of the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> from the Supreme Person, he changed his decision and became a worshiper of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who had Himself arranged the Battle of Kurukṣetra. Arjuna worshiped the Lord by fighting with his so-called relatives, and in this way he became a pure devotee of the Lord. Such accomplishments are possible only when one worships the real Kṛṣṇa and not some fabricated “Kṛṣṇa” invented by foolish men who are without knowledge of the intricacies of the science of Kṛṣṇa described in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> and <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em>.</div></div><div id="bb93664" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">According to the <em>Vedānta-sūtra, sambhūta</em> is the source of birth and sustenance, as well as the reservoir that remains after annihilation (<em>janmādy asya yataḥ</em>).

Certainly half-educated “spiritual leaders” who are disturbed by the tides of material existence cannot know Him fully. They try to make some compromise by making the mass of humanity the object of worship, but they do not know that such worship is only a myth because the masses are imperfect. The attempt by these so-called spiritual leaders is something like pouring water on the leaves of a tree instead of the root. The natural process is to pour water on the root, but such disturbed leaders are more attracted to the leaves than the root.

Instead of hearing of the activities of Lord Kṛṣṇa, such pseudo spiritual masters advertise themselves by inducing their followers to sing about <em>them.</em> In modern times the number of such pretenders has increased considerably, and it has become a problem for the pure devotees of the Lord to save the masses of people from the unholy propaganda of these pretenders and pseudo incarnations.</div></div><div id="bb93668" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The <em>Upaniṣads</em> indirectly draw our attention to the primeval Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, but the <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> which is the summary of all the <em>Upaniṣads,</em> directly points to Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

On the upper planets, time is calculated differently. One of our years is equal to only twenty-four hours, or one day and night, on many of the upper planets. The four ages of earth (Satya, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali) last only twelve thousand years according to the time scale of the upper planets. Such a length of time multiplied by one thousand constitutes one day of Brahmā, and one night of Brahmā is the same.

There are a great number of spiritual planets in this atmosphere, and these planets exist eternally, even when all the planets within this material universe are vanquished at the end of Brahmā’s life.

In His village of Vṛndāvana He enjoyed Himself with His mother, brother and friends, and when He played the role of a naughty butter thief, all His associates enjoyed celestial bliss by His stealing. The Lord’s fame as a butter thief is not reproachable, for by stealing butter the Lord gave pleasure to His pure devotees.

Although the Lord personally has nothing to do with material creation, maintenance and destruction, He causes all these things to be done by His plenary expansion, the Paramātmā.

And the impersonal transcendentalists are simply bewildered by the glaring effulgence of the <em>brahma-jyotir.</em> If one wants to see the Absolute Truth in full, one has to penetrate beyond the twenty-four material elements and the glaring effulgence as well. <em>Śrī Īśopaniṣad</em> points toward this direction, praying for the removal of the <em>hiraṇmaya-pātra,</em> the dazzling covering of the Lord. Unless this covering is removed so one can perceive the real face of the Personality of Godhead, factual realization of the Absolute Truth can never be achieved.</div></div><div id="bb93707" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The Paramātmā feature of the Personality of Godhead is one of three plenary expansions, or <em>viṣṇu-tattvas,</em> collectively known as the <em>puruṣa-avatāras.</em> One of these <em>viṣṇu-tattvas</em> who is within the universe is known as Kṣīrodaka-śāyī Viṣṇu. He is the Viṣṇu among the three principal deities – Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva – and He is the all-pervading Paramātmā in each and every individual living entity. The second <em>viṣṇu-tattva</em> within the universe is Garbhodaka-śāyī Viṣṇu, the collective Supersoul of all living entities. Beyond these two is Kāraṇodaka-śāyī Viṣṇu, who lies in the Causal Ocean. He is the creator of all universes. The <em>yoga</em> system teaches the serious student to meet the <em>viṣṇu-tattvas</em> after going beyond the twenty-four material elements of the cosmic creation. The culture of empiric philosophy helps one realize the impersonal <em>brahma-jyotir,</em> which is the glaring effulgence of the transcendental body of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

Śrīla Vyāsadeva never states that the Supreme Truth is a <em>jīva,</em> an ordinary living entity. The living entity should never be considered the all-powerful Supreme Truth.

Within the sun itself resides the sun-god, and similarly within the supreme spiritual planet, Goloka Vṛndāvana, from which the <em>brahma-jyotir</em> effulgence is emanating, the Lord enjoys His eternal pastimes, as verified in the <em>Brahma-saṁhitā</em> (5.29):</div></div><div id="bb93722" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic"><em>cintāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vṛkṣa-<br />lakṣāvṛteṣu surabhīr abhipālayantam<br />lakṣmī-sahasra-śata-sambhrama-sevyamānaṁ<br />govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi</em></div></div><div id="bb93723" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">“I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, the first progenitor, who is tending the cows fulfilling all desires in abodes filled with spiritual gems and surrounded by millions of wish-fulfilling trees.

Until one surpasses the glare of the <em>brahma-jyotir,</em> one cannot receive information of the land of the Lord. The impersonalist philosophers, blinded as they are by the dazzling <em>brahma-jyotir,</em> can realize neither the factual abode of the Lord nor His transcendental form. Limited by their poor fund of knowledge, such impersonalist thinkers cannot understand the all-blissful transcendental form of Lord Kṛṣṇa. In this prayer, therefore, <em>Śrī Īśopaniṣad</em> petitions the Lord to remove the effulgent rays of the <em>brahma-jyotir</em> so that the pure devotee can see His all-blissful transcendental form.</div></div><div id="bb93725" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">By realizing the impersonal <em>brahma-jyotir,</em> one experiences the auspicious aspect of the Supreme, and by realizing the Paramātmā, or all-pervading feature of the Supreme, one experiences an even more auspicious enlightenment. But by meeting the Personality of Godhead Himself face to face, the devotee experiences the most auspicious feature of the Supreme. Since He is addressed as the primeval philosopher and maintainer and well-wisher of the universe, the Supreme Truth cannot be impersonal. This is the verdict of <em>Śrī Īśopaniṣad.</em> The word <em>pūṣan</em> (“maintainer”) is especially significant, for although the Lord maintains all beings, He specifically maintains His devotees. After surpassing the impersonal <em>brahma-jyotir</em> and seeing the personal aspect of the Lord and His most auspicious eternal form, the devotee realizes the Absolute Truth in full.</div></div><div id="bb93726" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In his <em>Bhagavat-sandarbha,</em> Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī states: “The complete conception of the Absolute Truth is realized in the Personality of Godhead because He is almighty and possesses full transcendental potencies. The full potency of the Absolute Truth is not realized in the <em>brahma-jyotir;</em> therefore Brahman realization is only partial realization of the Personality of Godhead. O learned sages, the first syllable of the word <em>bhagavān</em> (<em>bha</em>) has two meanings: the first is ‘one who fully maintains,’ and the second is ‘guardian.’ The second syllable (<em>ga</em>) means ‘guide,’ ‘leader’ or ‘creator.’ The syllable <em>vān</em> indicates that every being lives in Him and that He also lives in every being. In other words, the transcendental sound <em>bhagavān</em> represents infinite knowledge, potency, energy, opulence, strength and influence – all without a tinge of material inebriety.”</div></div><div id="bb93727" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The Lord fully maintains His unalloyed devotees, and He guides them progressively on the path toward devotional perfection. As the leader of His devotees, He ultimately awards the desired results of devotional service by giving Himself to them. The devotees of the Lord see the Lord eye to eye by His causeless mercy; thus the Lord helps His devotees reach the supermost spiritual planet, Goloka Vṛndāvana. Being the creator, He can bestow all necessary qualifications upon His devotees so that they can ultimately reach Him. The Lord is the cause of all causes. In other words, since there is nothing that caused Him, He is the original cause. Consequently He enjoys His own Self by manifesting His own internal potency. The external potency is not exactly manifested by Him, for He expands Himself as the <em>puruṣas,</em> and it is in these forms that He maintains the features of the material manifestation. By such expansions, He creates, maintains and annihilates the cosmic manifestation.</div></div><div id="bb93728" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The living entities are also differentiated expansions of the Lord’s Self, and because some of them desire to be lords and imitate the Supreme Lord, He allows them to enter into the cosmic creation with the option to fully utilize their propensity to lord it over nature. Because of the presence of His parts and parcels, the living entities, the entire phenomenal world is stirred into action and reaction. Thus the living entities are given full facilities to lord it over material nature, but the ultimate controller is the Lord Himself in His plenary feature as Paramātmā, the Supersoul, who is one of the <em>puruṣas</em>.</div></div><div id="bb93729" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Thus there is a gulf of difference between the living entity (<em>ātmā</em>) and the controlling Lord (Paramātmā), the soul and the Supersoul. Paramātmā is the controller, and the <em>ātmā</em> is the controlled; therefore they are in different categories. Because the Paramātmā fully cooperates with the <em>ātmā,</em> He is known as the constant companion of the living being.</div></div><div id="bb93730" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The all-pervading feature of the Lord – which exists in all circumstances of waking and sleeping as well as in potential states and from which the <em>jīva-śakti</em> (living force) is generated as both conditioned and liberated souls – is known as Brahman. Since the Lord is the origin of both Paramātmā and Brahman, He is the origin of all living entities and all else that exists. One who knows this engages himself at once in the devotional service of the Lord. Such a pure and fully cognizant devotee of the Lord is fully attached to Him in heart and soul, and whenever such a devotee assembles with similar devotees, they have no engagement but the glorification of the Lord’s transcendental activities. Those who are not as perfect as the pure devotees – namely, those who have realized only the Brahman or Paramātmā features of the Lord – cannot appreciate the activities of the perfect devotees. The Lord always helps the pure devotees by imparting necessary knowledge within their hearts, and thus out of His special favor He dissipates all the darkness of ignorance. The speculative philosophers and <em>yogīs</em> cannot imagine this, because they more or less depend on their own strength. As stated in the <em>Kaṭha Upaniṣad</em> (1.2.23), the Lord can be known only by those whom He favors, and not by anyone else. Such special favors are bestowed upon His pure devotees only. <em>Śrī Īśopaniṣad</em> thus points to the favor of the Lord, which is beyond the purview of the <em>brahma-jyotir</em>.</div></div></div></div><div><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 id="bb93731" class="text-center em:leading-5 em:text-3xl em:mt-3 em:mb-3"><a href="/en/library/iso/17/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline">Mantra Seventeen</a></h2></div><div class="av-verse_text"><h3 class="text-center em:leading-5 em:text-xl font-bold em:mb-4 hidden">Verse text</h3><div id="bb93732" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic"><em>vāyur anilam amṛtam<br />athedaṁ bhasmāntaṁ śarīram<br />oṁ krato smara kṛtaṁ smara<br />krato smara kṛtaṁ smara</em></div></div></div><div class="av-synonyms"><h3 class="text-center em:leading-5 em:text-xl font-bold em:mb-4">Synonyms</h3><div id="bb93733" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-justify"><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=vāyuḥ" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>vāyuḥ</em></a> — <span class="inline">air of life</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=anilam" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>anilam</em></a> — <span class="inline">total reservoir of air</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=amṛtam" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>amṛtam</em></a> — <span class="inline">indestructible</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=atha" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>atha</em></a> — <span class="inline">now</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=idam" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>idam</em></a> — <span class="inline">this</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=bhasmāntam" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>bhasmāntam</em></a> — <span class="inline">after being turned to ashes</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=śarīram" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>śarīram</em></a> — <span class="inline">body</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=oṁ" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>oṁ</em></a> — <span class="inline">O Lord</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=krato" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>krato</em></a> — <span class="inline">O enjoyer of all sacrifices</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=smara" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>smara</em></a> — <span class="inline">please remember</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=kṛtam" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>kṛtam</em></a> — <span class="inline">all that has been done by me</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=smara" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>smara</em></a> — <span class="inline">please remember</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=krato" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>krato</em></a> — <span class="inline">O supreme beneficiary</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=smara" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>smara</em></a> — <span class="inline">please remember</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=kṛtam" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>kṛtam</em></a> — <span class="inline">all that I have done for You</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=smara" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>smara</em></a> — <span class="inline">please remember</span>.</span></div></div></div><div class="av-translation"><h3 class="text-center em:leading-5 em:text-xl font-bold em:mb-4">Translation</h3><div id="bb93734" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>Let this temporary body be burnt to ashes, and let the air of life be merged with the totality of air.

The identity of the living entity is never impersonal or formless; on the contrary, it is the material dress that is formless and that takes a shape according to the form of the indestructible person. No living entity is originally formless, as is wrongly thought by those with a poor fund of knowledge. This <em>mantra</em> verifies the fact that the living entity exists after the annihilation of the material body.</div></div><div id="bb93736" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the material world, material nature displays wonderful workmanship by creating varieties of bodies for the living beings according to their propensities for sense gratification. The living entity who wants to taste stool is given a material body that is quite suitable for eating stool – that of a hog. Similarly, one who wants to eat the flesh and blood of other animals may be given a tiger’s body equipped with suitable teeth and claws. But the human being is not meant for eating flesh, nor does he have any desire to taste stool, even in the most aboriginal state. Human teeth are so made that they can chew and cut fruit and vegetables, although there are two canine teeth so that primitive humans can eat flesh if they so desire.</div></div><div id="bb93737" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">But in any case, the material bodies of all animals and men are foreign to the living entity. They change according to the living entity’s desire for sense gratification. In the cycle of evolution, the living entity changes bodies one after another. When the world was full of water, the living entity took an aquatic form. Then he passed to vegetable life, from vegetable life to worm life, from worm life to bird life, from bird life to animal life, and from animal life to the human form. The highest developed form is this human form when it is possessed of a full sense of spiritual knowledge. The highest development of one’s spiritual sense is described in this <em>mantra:</em> One should give up the material body, which will be turned to ashes, and allow the air of life to merge into the eternal reservoir of air. The living being’s activities are performed within the body through the movements of different kinds of air, known in summary as <em>prāṇa-vāyu.</em> The <em>yogīs</em> generally study how to control the airs of the body. The soul is supposed to rise from one circle of air to another until it rises to the <em>brahma-randhra,</em> the highest circle. From that point the perfect <em>yogī</em> can transfer himself to any planet he likes. The process is to give up one material body and then enter into another. But the highest perfection of such changes occurs only when the living entity is able to give up the material body altogether, as suggested in this <em>mantra,</em> and enter into the spiritual atmosphere, where he can develop a completely different type of body – a spiritual body, which never has to meet death or change.</div></div><div id="bb93738" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Here in the material world, material nature forces the living entity to change his body due to his different desires for sense gratification. These desires are represented in the various species of life, from germs to the most perfected material bodies, those of Brahmā and the demigods. All of these living entities have bodies composed of matter in different shapes. The intelligent man sees oneness not in the variety of the bodies but in the spiritual identity. The spiritual spark, which is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is the same whether he is in a body of a hog or in the body of a demigod. The living entity takes on different bodies according to his pious and vicious activities. The human body is highly developed and has full consciousness. According to the <a href="/en/library/bg/7/19/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (7.19)</a>, the most perfect man surrenders unto the Lord after many, many lifetimes of culturing knowledge. The culture of knowledge reaches perfection only when the knower comes to the point of surrendering unto the Supreme Lord, Vāsudeva. Otherwise, even after attaining knowledge of one’s spiritual identity, if one does not come to the point of knowing that the living entities are eternal parts and parcels of the whole and can never become the whole, one has to fall down again into the material atmosphere. Indeed, one must fall down even if he has become one with the <em>brahma-jyotir</em>.</div></div><div id="bb93739" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">As we have learned from previous <em>mantras,</em> the <em>brahma-jyotir</em> emanating from the transcendental body of the Lord is full of spiritual sparks that are individual entities with the full sense of existence. Sometimes these living entities want to enjoy their senses, and therefore they are placed in the material world to become false lords under the dictation of the senses. The desire for lordship is the material disease of the living being, for under the spell of sense enjoyment he transmigrates through the various bodies manifested in the material world. Becoming one with the <em>brahma-jyotir</em> does not represent mature knowledge. Only by surrendering unto the Lord completely and developing one’s sense of spiritual service does one reach the highest perfectional stage.</div></div><div id="bb93740" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In this <em>mantra</em> the living entity prays to enter the spiritual kingdom of God after relinquishing his material body and material air. The devotee prays to the Lord to remember his activities and the sacrifices he has performed before his material body is turned into ashes. He makes this prayer at the time of death, with full consciousness of his past deeds and of the ultimate goal. One who is completely under the rule of material nature remembers the heinous activities he performed during the existence of his material body, and consequently he gets another material body after death. The <a href="/en/library/bg/8/6/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (8.6)</a> confirms this truth:</div></div><div id="bb93741" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic"><em>yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran bhāvaṁ<br />tyajaty ante kalevaram<br />taṁ tam evaiti kaunteya<br />sadā tad-bhāva-bhāvitaḥ</em></div></div><div id="bb93742" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">“Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, O son of Kuntī, that state he will attain without fail.” Thus the mind carries the living entity’s propensities into the next life.</div></div><div id="bb93743" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Unlike the simple animals, who have no developed mind, the dying human being can remember the activities of his life like dreams at night; therefore his mind remains surcharged with material desires, and consequently he cannot enter into the spiritual kingdom with a spiritual body. The devotees, however, develop a sense of love for Godhead by practicing devotional service to the Lord. Even if at the time of death a devotee does not remember his service to the Lord, the Lord does not forget him. This prayer is given to remind the Lord of the devotee’s sacrifices, but even if there is no such reminder, the Lord does not forget the service rendered by His pure devotee.</div></div><div id="bb93744" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The Lord clearly describes His intimate relationship with His devotees in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (9.30–34): “Even if one commits the most abominable action, if he is engaged in devotional service he is to be considered saintly because he is properly situated in his determination. He quickly becomes righteous and attains lasting peace. O son of Kuntī, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes. O son of Pṛthā, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth – women, <em>vaiśyas</em> [merchants] as well as <em>śūdras</em> [workers] – can attain the supreme destination. How much more this is so of the righteous <em>brāhmaṇas,</em> the devotees and the saintly kings. Therefore, having come to this temporary, miserable world, engage in loving service unto Me. Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, become My devotee, offer obeisances to Me and worship Me.

Social status, mental development, cleanliness, austerity, nourishment and the struggle for existence are all for the maintenance of the body. The self-realization part of one’s activities is executed in one’s occupation as a devotee of the Lord, and one performs actions in that connection also. One must perform these two different functions along parallel lines, because a conditioned soul cannot give up the maintenance of his body. The proportion of activities for maintenance of the body decreases, however, in proportion to the increase in devotional service. As long as the proportion of devotional service does not come to the right point, there is a chance for an occasional exhibition of worldliness. But it should be noted that such worldliness cannot continue for long because, by the grace of the Lord, such imperfections will come to an end very shortly. Therefore the path of devotional service is the only right path. If one is on the right path, even an occasional occurrence of worldliness does not hamper one in the advancement of self-realization.”</div></div><div id="bb93746" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The facilities of devotional service are denied the impersonalists because they are attached to the <em>brahma-jyotir</em> feature of the Lord. As suggested in the previous <em>mantras,</em> they cannot penetrate the <em>brahma-jyotir</em> because they do not believe in the Personality of Godhead. Their business is mostly word jugglery and mental speculation. Consequently the impersonalists pursue a fruitless labor, as confirmed in the twelfth chapter of the <a href="/en/library/bg/12/5/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (12.5)</a>.</div></div><div id="bb93747" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">All the facilities suggested in this <em>mantra</em> can be easily obtained by constant contact with the personal feature of the Absolute Truth. Devotional service to the Lord consists essentially of nine transcendental activities: (1) hearing about the Lord, (2) glorifying the Lord, (3) remembering the Lord, (4) serving the lotus feet of the Lord, (5) worshiping the Lord, (6) offering prayers to the Lord, (7) serving the Lord, (8) enjoying friendly association with the Lord, and (9) surrendering everything unto the Lord. These nine principles of devotional service – taken all together or one by one – help a devotee remain constantly in touch with God. In this way, at the end of life it is easy for the devotee to remember the Lord. By adopting only one of these nine principles, the following renowned devotees of the Lord were able to achieve the highest perfection: (1) By hearing of the Lord, Mahārāja Parīkṣit, the hero of <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</em> attained the desired result. (2) Just by glorifying the Lord, Śukadeva Gosvāmī, the speaker of <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</em> attained his perfection. (3) By praying to the Lord, Akrūra attained the desired result. (4) By remembering the Lord, Prahlāda Mahārāja attained the desired result. (5) By worshiping the Lord, Pṛthu Mahārāja attained perfection. (6) By serving the lotus feet of the Lord, the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, attained perfection. (7) By rendering personal service to the Lord, Hanumān attained the desired result. (8) Through his friendship with the Lord, Arjuna attained the desired result.

One should therefore not indulge in hearing and speaking of the rubbish activities of worldly politicians and so-called big men in society but should mold his life in such a way that he can engage in godly activities without wasting a second. <em>Śrī Īśopaniṣad</em> directs us toward such godly activities.</div></div><div id="bb93753" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Unless one is accustomed to devotional practice, what will he remember at the time of death, when the body is dislocated, and how can he pray to the almighty Lord to remember his sacrifices? Sacrifice means denying the interest of the senses. One has to learn this art by employing the senses in the service of the Lord during one’s lifetime. One can utilize the results of such practice at the time of death.</div></div></div></div><div><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 id="bb93754" class="text-center em:leading-5 em:text-3xl em:mt-3 em:mb-3"><a href="/en/library/iso/18/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline">Mantra Eighteen</a></h2></div><div class="av-verse_text"><h3 class="text-center em:leading-5 em:text-xl font-bold em:mb-4 hidden">Verse text</h3><div id="bb93755" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic"><em>agne naya supathā rāye asmān<br />viśvāni deva vayunāni vidvān<br />yuyodhy asmaj juhurāṇam eno<br />bhūyiṣṭhāṁ te nama-uktiṁ vidhema</em></div></div></div><div class="av-synonyms"><h3 class="text-center em:leading-5 em:text-xl font-bold em:mb-4">Synonyms</h3><div id="bb93756" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-justify"><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=agne" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>agne</em></a> — <span class="inline">O my Lord, as powerful as fire</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=naya" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>naya</em></a> — <span class="inline">kindly lead</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=supathā" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>supathā</em></a> — <span class="inline">by the right path</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=rāye" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>rāye</em></a> — <span class="inline">for reaching You</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=asmān" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>asmān</em></a> — <span class="inline">us</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=viśvāni" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>viśvāni</em></a> — <span class="inline">all</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=deva" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>deva</em></a> — <span class="inline">O my Lord</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=vayunāni" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>vayunāni</em></a> — <span class="inline">actions</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=vidvān" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>vidvān</em></a> — <span class="inline">the knower</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=yuyodhi" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>yuyodhi</em></a> — <span class="inline">kindly remove</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=asmat" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>asmat</em></a> — <span class="inline">from us</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=juhurāṇam" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>juhurāṇam</em></a> — <span class="inline">all hindrances on the path</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=enaḥ" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>enaḥ</em></a> — <span class="inline">all vices</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=bhūyiṣṭhām" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>bhūyiṣṭhām</em></a> — <span class="inline">most numerous</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=te" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>te</em></a> — <span class="inline">unto You</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=namaḥ" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>namaḥ</em></a> <a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=uktim" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>uktim</em></a> — <span class="inline">words of obeisance</span>; </span><span class="inline"><a href="/en/search/synonyms/?original=vidhema" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>vidhema</em></a> — <span class="inline">I do</span>.</span></div></div></div><div class="av-translation"><h3 class="text-center em:leading-5 em:text-xl font-bold em:mb-4">Translation</h3><div id="bb93757" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>O my Lord, as powerful as fire, O omnipotent one, now I offer You all obeisances, falling on the ground at Your feet.

The Lord is addressed as fire because He can burn anything into ashes, including the sins of the surrendered soul. As described in the previous <em>mantras,</em> the real or ultimate aspect of the Absolute is His feature as the Personality of Godhead, and His impersonal <em>brahma-jyotir</em> feature is a dazzling covering over His face. Fruitive activities, or the <em>karma-kāṇḍa</em> path of self-realization, is the lowest stage in this endeavor. As soon as such activities even slightly deviate from the regulative principles of the <em>Vedas,</em> they are transformed into <em>vikarma,</em> or acts against the interest of the actor. Such <em>vikarma</em> is enacted by the illusioned living entity simply for sense gratification, and thus such activities become hindrances on the path of self-realization.</div></div><div id="bb93759" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Self-realization is possible in the human form of life, but not in other forms. There are 8,400,000 species, or forms of life, of which the human form qualified by brahminical culture presents the only chance to obtain knowledge of transcendence. Brahminical culture includes truthfulness, sense control, forbearance, simplicity, full knowledge and full faith in God. It is not that one simply becomes proud of his high parentage. Just as being born the son of a big man affords one a chance to become a big man, so being born the son of a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> gives one a chance to become a <em>brāhmaṇa.</em> But such a birthright is not everything, for one still has to attain the brahminical qualifications for himself. As soon as one becomes proud of his birth as the son of a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> and neglects to acquire the qualifications of a real <em>brāhmaṇa,</em> he at once becomes degraded and falls from the path of self-realization. Thus his life’s mission as a human being is defeated.</div></div><div id="bb93760" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (6.41–42) we are assured by the Lord that the <em>yoga-bhraṣṭas,</em> or souls fallen from the path of self-realization, are given a chance to rectify themselves by taking birth either in the families of good <em>brāhmaṇas</em> or in the families of rich merchants. Such births afford higher chances for self-realization. If these chances are misused due to illusion, one loses the good opportunity of human life afforded by the almighty Lord.</div></div><div id="bb93761" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The regulative principles are such that one who follows them is promoted from the platform of fruitive activities to the platform of transcendental knowledge. After many, many lifetimes of cultivating transcendental knowledge, one becomes perfect when he surrenders unto the Lord. This is the general procedure. But one who surrenders at the very beginning, as recommended in this <em>mantra,</em> at once surpasses all preliminary stages simply by adopting the devotional attitude. As stated in the <a href="/en/library/bg/18/66/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (18.66)</a>, the Lord at once takes charge of such a surrendered soul and frees him from all the reactions to his sinful acts. There are many sinful reactions involved in <em>karma-kāṇḍa</em> activities, whereas in <em>jñāna-kāṇḍa,</em> the path of philosophical development, the number of such sinful activities is smaller. But in devotional service to the Lord, the path of <em>bhakti,</em> there is practically no chance of incurring sinful reactions, because a devotee of the Lord attains all the good qualifications of the Lord Himself, what to speak of those of a <em>brāhmaṇa.</em> A devotee automatically attains the qualifications of an expert <em>brāhmaṇa</em> authorized to perform sacrifices, even though the devotee may not have taken his birth in a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> family. Such is the omnipotence of the Lord. He can make a man born in a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> family as degraded as a lowborn dog-eater, and He can also make a lowborn dog-eater superior to a qualified <em>brāhmaṇa</em> simply on the strength of devotional service.</div></div><div id="bb93762" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Since the omnipotent Lord is situated within the heart of everyone, He can give directions to His sincere devotees by which they can attain the right path. Such directions are especially offered to the devotee, even if he desires something else. As far as others are concerned, God gives sanction to the doer only at the risk of the doer. But in the case of a devotee, the Lord directs him in such a way that he never acts wrongly. The <a href="/en/library/sb/11/5/42/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> (11.5.42)</a> says:</div></div><div id="bb93763" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic"><em>sva-pāda-mūlaṁ bhajataḥ priyasya<br />tyaktānya-bhāvasya hariḥ pareśaḥ<br />vikarma yac cotpatitaṁ kathañcid<br />dhunoti sarvaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭaḥ</em></div></div><div id="bb93764" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">“The Lord is so kind to the devotee who is fully surrendered to His lotus feet that even though the devotee sometimes falls into the entanglement of <em>vikarma</em> – acts against the Vedic directions – the Lord at once rectifies such mistakes from within his heart.

To err is human. A conditioned soul is very often apt to commit mistakes, and the only remedial measure to take against such unintentional sins is to give oneself up to the lotus feet of the Lord so that He may guide one to avoid such pitfalls. The Lord takes charge of fully surrendered souls; thus all problems are solved simply by surrendering oneself unto the Lord and acting in terms of His directions. Such directions are given to the sincere devotee in two ways: one is by way of the saints, scriptures and spiritual master, and the other is by way of the Lord Himself, who resides within the heart of everyone. Thus the devotee, fully enlightened with Vedic knowledge, is protected in all respects.</div></div><div id="bb93766" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Vedic knowledge is transcendental and cannot be understood by mundane educational procedures. One can understand the Vedic <em>mantras</em> only by the grace of the Lord and the spiritual master (<em>yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau</em>). If one takes shelter of a bona fide spiritual master, it is to be understood that he has obtained the grace of the Lord. The Lord appears as the spiritual master for the devotee. Thus the spiritual master, the Vedic injunctions and the Lord Himself from within – all guide the devotee in full strength. In this way there is no chance for a devotee to fall again into the mire of material illusion. The devotee, thus protected all around, is sure to reach the ultimate destination of perfection. The entire process is hinted at in this <em>mantra,</em> and <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> (1.2.17–20) explains it further:</div></div><div id="bb93767" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord is itself an act of piety. The Lord wants everyone to hear and chant His glories because He is the well-wisher of all living entities. By hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord, one becomes cleansed of all undesirable things, and then one’s devotion becomes fixed upon the Lord. At this stage the devotee acquires the brahminical qualifications, and the effects of the lower modes of nature (passion and ignorance) completely vanish. The devotee becomes fully enlightened by virtue of his devotional service, and thus he comes to know the path of the Lord and the way to attain Him. As all doubts diminish, he becomes a pure devotee.</div></div><div id="bb93768" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify italic"><em>Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to</em> Śrī Īśopaniṣad,<em> the knowledge that brings one nearer to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa.</em></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="mt-10 flex justify-between"><a href="/en/library/cc/" class="inline-flex font-sans items-center px-4 py-2 mr-4 text-base font-medium bg-vb-header-top bg-opacity-30 border border-vb-header-top border-opacity-30 rounded-lg hover:bg-opacity-50"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 448 512" class="mr-2" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M257.5 445.1l-22.2 22.2c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0L7 273c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9L201.4 44.7c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0l22.2 22.2c9.5 9.5 9.3 25-.4 34.3L136.6 216H424c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24v32c0 13.3-10.7 24-24 24H136.6l120.5 114.8c9.8 9.3 10 24.8.4 34.3z"></path></svg>Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta</a><a href="/en/library/bbd/" class="inline-flex font-sans items-center px-4 py-2 text-base font-medium bg-vb-header-top bg-opacity-30 border border-vb-header-top border-opacity-30 rounded-lg hover:bg-opacity-50">Beyond Birth and Death<svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 448 512" class="ml-2" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M190.5 66.9l22.2-22.2c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0L441 239c9.4 9.4 9.4 24.6 0 33.9L246.6 467.3c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0l-22.2-22.2c-9.5-9.5-9.3-25 .4-34.3L311.4 296H24c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24v-32c0-13.3 10.7-24 24-24h287.4L190.9 101.2c-9.8-9.3-10-24.8-.4-34.3z"></path></svg></a></div></main></div><div id="footer" class="mt-auto pt-3 mb-6 text-sm text-vb-normal-text/80 text-center"><div class="px-4 py-4 w-full max-w-screen-xl mx-auto md:px-8 text-sm text-vb-normal-text/80"><div class="py-2 px-3 border border-dashed border-vb-normal-text/15 text-justify relative "><a href="/en/donate/" class="z-20 float-right my-2 ml-3 w-auto border border-vb-action-border bg-vb-action-bg hover:bg-vb-action-bg/80 rounded-md text-vb-action-text py-3 px-6 text-center disabled:opacity-50">Donate</a><span class="flex-grow">Thanks to <span>Vinod Bapat and Meenal Bapat; Mahavisnupriya dasi &amp; Gostavihari das;   Kuldip Persaud; Gagan Kangovi; Rajendra and Geeta Ramchandani; NIOS - North American Institute for Oriental and Classical Studies; Jaykumar Prabhakar; Anantha SriSimha das, Spore; Bharat Vyas; HG Lakshmipati Narayan Das; HG Ragatmika Gopika Devi Dasi; Shri Chander Mohan Gilhotra; HG Prashant Mukund Das; Shri Trilok Singh Grover; Aneesh Koppula; Ronak Talati; Bhargav Ashok; J.K Ahuja; Akiralali; Radhapati Das; Bimal Gupta; Rajasa das; Aishwarya Balaraj; Yogendra Sharad Puranik; Riya and Tejal Chopade; Devarajula Pradeep Kumar (Saroornagar, Hyderabad); Late Chetana Dilip Bhatt; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/indradyumna-swami">Indradyumna Swami</a>; Sachin; Geetanjali Nath; Mario; Joeie; Susheela and Rama Krishna Reddy Patlolla; Jai Devaki Parks; Ashmi Chakraborty; Hari-kirtana das; Ramesta das; Prasad Buddhavarapu; dasa; Kresna Sucandra; Late Mr. S.

What are the \u003cem\u003eVedas\u003c/em\u003e? The Sanskrit verbal root of \u003cem\u003eveda\u003c/em\u003e can be interpreted variously, but the purport is finally one. \u003cem\u003eVeda\u003c/em\u003e means knowledge. Any knowledge you accept is \u003cem\u003eveda,\u003c/em\u003e for the teachings of the \u003cem\u003eVedas\u003c/em\u003e are the original knowledge. In the conditioned state, our knowledge is subjected to many deficiencies. The difference between a conditioned soul and a liberated soul is that the conditioned soul has four kinds of defects. The first defect is that he must commit mistakes. For example, in our country, Mahatma Gandhi was considered to be a very great personality, but he committed many mistakes. Even at the last stage of his life, his assistant warned, “Mahatma Gandhi, don’t go to the New Delhi meeting. I have some friends, and I have heard there is danger.” But he did not hear. He persisted in going and was killed. Even great personalities like Mahatma Gandhi, President Kennedy – there are so many of them – make mistakes. To err is human. This is one defect of the conditioned soul.2e:T698,You may call the \u003cem\u003eVedas\u003c/em\u003e Hindu, but “Hindu” is a foreign name. We are not Hindus. Our real identification is \u003cem\u003evarṇāśrama\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cem\u003eVarṇāśrama\u003c/em\u003e denotes the followers of the \u003cem\u003eVedas,\u003c/em\u003e those who accept the human society in eight divisions of \u003cem\u003evarṇa\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eāśrama.\u003c/em\u003e There are four divisions of society and four divisions of spiritual life. This is called \u003cem\u003evarṇāśrama.\u003c/em\u003e It is stated in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā,\u003c/em\u003e “These divisions are everywhere because they are created by God.” The divisions of society are \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra. Brāhmaṇa\u003c/em"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\u003e refers to the very intelligent class of men, those who know what is Brahman. Similarly, the \u003cem\u003ekṣatriyas,\u003c/em\u003e the administrator group, are the next intelligent class of men. Then the \u003cem\u003evaiśyas,\u003c/em\u003e the mercantile group. These natural classifications are found everywhere. This is the Vedic principle, and we accept it. Vedic principles are accepted as axiomatic truth, for there cannot be any mistake. That is acceptance. For instance, in India cow dung is accepted as pure, and yet cow dung is the stool of an animal. In one place you’ll find the Vedic injunction that if you touch stool, you have to take a bath immediately. But in another place it is said that the stool of a cow is pure. If you smear cow dung in an impure place, that place becomes pure. With our ordinary sense we can argue, “This is contradictory.” Actually, it is contradictory from the ordinary point of view, but it is not false. It is fact. In Calcutta, a very prominent scientist and doctor analyzed cow dung and found that it contains all antiseptic properties.2f:T6f8,The \u003cem\u003eVedas\u003c/em\u003e are considered to be the mother, and Brahmā is called the grandfather, the forefather, because he was the first to be instructed in the Vedic knowledge. In the beginning the first living creature was Brahmā. He received this Vedic knowledge and imparted it to Nārada and other disciples and sons, and they also distributed it to their disciples. In this way, the Vedic knowledge comes down by disciplic succession. It is also confirmed in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e that Vedic knowledge is understood in this way. If you make experimental endeavor, you come to the same conclusion, but just to save time you should accept. If you want to know who your father is and if you accept your mother as the authority, then whatever she says can be accepted without argument. There are three kinds of evidence: \u003cem\u003epratyakṣa, anumāna\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eśabda. Pratyakṣa\u003c/em\u003e means “direct evidence.” Direct evidence is not very good because our senses are not perfe"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"ct. We are seeing the sun daily, and it appears to us just like a small disc, but it is actually far, far larger than many planets. Of what value is this seeing? Therefore we have to read books; then we can understand about the sun. So direct experience is not perfect. Then there is \u003cem\u003eanumāna,\u003c/em\u003e inductive knowledge: “It may be like this” – hypothesis. For instance, Darwin’s theory says it may be like this, it may be like that. But that is not science. That is a suggestion, and it is also not perfect. But if you receive the knowledge from the authoritative sources, that is perfect. If you receive a program guide from the radio station authorities, you accept it. You don’t deny it; you don’t have to make an experiment, because it is received from the authoritative sources.30:Tb90,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"There is a spiritual sky. There is another nature, which is beyond manifestation and nonmanifestation. But how will you know that there is a sky where the planets and inhabitants are eternal? All this knowledge is there, but how will you make experiments? It is not possible. Therefore you have to take the assistance of the \u003cem\u003eVedas.\u003c/em\u003e This is called Vedic knowledge. In our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement we are accepting knowledge from the highest authority, Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is accepted as the highest authority by all classes of men. I am speaking first of the two classes of transcendentalists. One class of transcendentalists is called impersonalistic, Māyāvādī. They are generally known as Vedāntists, led by Śaṅkarācārya. And there is another class of transcendentalists, called Vaiṣṇavas, like Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Viṣṇu Svāmī. Both the Śaṅkara-sampradāya and the Vaiṣṇava-sampradāya have accepted Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Śaṅkarācārya is supposed to be an impersonalist who preached impersonalism, impersonal Brahman, but it is a fact that he is a covered personalist. In his commentary on the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e he wrote, “Nārāyaṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is beyond this cosmic manifestation.” And then again he confirmed, “That Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nārāyaṇa, is Kṛṣṇa. He has come as the son of Devakī and Vasudeva.” He particularly mentioned the names of His father and mother. So Kṛṣṇa is accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead by all transcendentalists. There is no doubt about it. Our source of knowledge in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā,\u003c/em\u003e which comes directly from Kṛṣṇa. We have published \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā As It Is\u003c/em\u003e because we accept Kṛṣṇa as He is speaking, without any interpretation. That is Vedic knowledge. Since the Vedic knowledge is pure, we accept it. Whatever Kṛṣṇa says, we accept. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That saves much time. If you accept the right authority, or source of knowledge, then you save much time. For example, there are two systems of knowledge in the material world: inductive and deductive. From deductive, you accept that man is mortal. Your father says man is mortal, your sister says man is mortal, everyone says man is mortal – but you do not experiment. You accept it as a fact that man is mortal. If you want to research to find out whether man is mortal, you have to study each and every man, and you may come to think that there may be some man who is not dying but you have not seen him yet. So in this way your research will never be finished. In Sanskrit this process is called \u003cem\u003eāroha,\u003c/em\u003e the ascending process. If you want to attain knowledge by any personal endeavor, by exercising your imperfect senses, you will never come to the right conclusions. That is not possible."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"31:T5f8,This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is completely authorized from Vedic principles. In the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e Kṛṣṇa says, “The actual aim of Vedic research is to find out Kṛṣṇa.” In the \u003cem\u003eBrahma-saṁhitā\u003c/em\u003e it is also stated, “Kṛṣṇa, Govinda, has innumerable forms, but they are all one.” They are not like our forms, which are fallible. His form is infallible. My form has a beginning, but His form has no beginning. It is \u003cem\u003eananta.\u003c/em\u003e And His form – so many multiforms – has no end. My form is sitting here and not in my apartment. You are sitting there and not in your apartment. But Kṛṣṇa can be everywhere at one time. He can sit down in Goloka Vṛndāvana, and at the same time He is everywhere, all-pervading. He is original, the oldest, but whenever you look at a picture of Kṛṣṇa you’ll find a young boy fifteen or twenty years old. You will never find an old man. You have seen pictures of Kṛṣṇa as a charioteer from the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā.\u003c/em\u003e At that time He was not less than one hundred years old. He had great-grandchildren, but He looked just like a boy. Kṛṣṇa, God, never becomes old. That is His supreme power. And if you want to search out Kṛṣṇa by studying the Vedic literature, then you will be baffled. It may be possible, but it is very difficult. But you can very easily learn about Him from His devotee. His devotee can deliver Him to you: “Here He is, take Him.” That is the potency of Kṛṣṇa’s devotees.32:T6a1,Originally there was only one \u003cem\u003eVeda,\u003c/em\u003e and there was no necessity of reading it.

Vegetables also have life, and while it is nature’s law that one living being is meant to feed on another, for human beings the point is to recognize the Supreme Lord. Thus one should not be proud of being a strict vegetarian. Animals do not have developed consciousness by which to recognize the Lord, but a human being is sufficiently intelligent to take lessons from the Vedic literature and thereby know how the laws of nature are working and derive profit out of such knowledge. If a man neglects the instructions of the Vedic literature, his life becomes very risky. A human being is therefore required to recognize the authority of the Supreme Lord and become His devotee. He must offer everything for the Lord’s service and partake only of the remnants of food offered to the Lord. This will enable him to discharge his duty properly.

The greatest danger of life is the danger of gliding down again into the evolutionary cycle of birth and death among the 8,400,000 species. If somehow or other a man misses the spiritual opportunity afforded by his human form of life and falls down again into the evolutionary cycle, he must be considered most unfortunate. Due to his defective senses, a foolish man cannot see that this is happening. Consequently \u003cem\u003eŚrī Īśopaniṣad\u003c/em\u003e advises us to exert our energy in the spirit of \u003cem\u003eīśāvāsya.\u003c/em\u003e Being so engaged, we may wish to live for many, many years; otherwise a long life in itself has no value.

Why is a highly placed government servant given better facilities than those of an ordinary clerk? The answer is that a highly placed officer has to discharge duties of a higher nature. Similarly, the duties human beings have to perform are higher than those of animals, who are always engaged in simply feeding their hungry stomachs. Yet the modern soul-killing civilization has only increased the problems of the hungry stomach. When we approach a polished animal in the form of a modern civilized man and ask him to take interest in self-realization, he will say that he simply wants to work to satisfy his stomach and that there is no need of self-realization for a hungry man. The laws of nature are so cruel, however, that despite his denunciation of the need for self-realization and his eagerness to work hard to fill his stomach, he is always threatened by unemployment.3b:T66c,In the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e (6.41–43) it is stated that a man who enters upon the path of self-realization but does not complete the process, despite having sincerely tried to realize his relationship with God, is given a chance to appear in a family of \u003cem\u003eśuci\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eśrīmat.\u003c/em\u003e The word \u003cem\u003eśuci\u003c/em\u003e indicates a spiritually advanced \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa,\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eśrīmat\u003c/em\u003e indicates a \u003cem\u003evaiśya,\u003c/em\u003e a member of the mercantile community.

If even a fallen candidate is given a chance to take birth in a respectable and noble family, one can hardly imagine the status of one who has achieved success. By simply attempting to realize God, one is guaranteed birth in a wealthy or aristocratic family.

He can be known only by His devotees through His mercy. In the \u003cem\u003eBrahma-saṁhitā\u003c/em\u003e (5.34) it is stated that even if a nondevotee philosopher travels through space at the speed of the wind or the mind for hundreds of millions of years, he will still find that the Absolute Truth is far, far away from him. The \u003cem\u003eBrahma-saṁhitā\u003c/em\u003e (5.37) further describes that the Absolute Personality of Godhead has His transcendental abode, known as Goloka, where He remains and engages in His pastimes, yet by His inconceivable potencies He can simultaneously reach every part of His creative energy. In the \u003cem\u003eViṣṇu Purāṇa\u003c/em\u003e His potencies are compared to the heat and light that emanate from a fire. Although situated in one place, a fire can distribute its light and heat for some distance; similarly, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, although fixed in His transcendental abode, can diffuse His different energies everywhere.3d:T435,In this connection, two words the revealed scriptures often apply to the Lord – \u003cem\u003esaguṇa\u003c/em\u003e (“with qualities”) and \u003cem\u003enirguṇa\u003c/em\u003e (“without qualities”) – are very important. The word \u003cem\u003esaguṇa\u003c/em\u003e does not imply that when the Lord appears with perceivable qualities He must take on a material form and be subject to the laws of material nature. For Him there is no difference between the material and spirit"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"ual energies, because He is the source of all energies. As the controller of all energies, He cannot at any time be under their influence, as we are.

(In this sense He is \u003cem\u003enirguṇa,\u003c/em\u003e “without qualities.”) Nor does the Lord become a formless entity at any time, for ultimately He is the eternal form, the primeval Lord. His impersonal aspect, or Brahman effulgence, is but the glow of His personal rays, just as the sun’s rays are the glow of the sun-god.3e:T539,When the child saint Prahlāda Mahārāja was in the presence of his atheist father, his father asked him, “Where is your God?” When Prahlāda replied that God resides everywhere, the father angrily asked whether his God was within one of the pillars of the palace, and the child said yes. At once the atheist king shattered the pillar in front of him to pieces, and the Lord instantly appeared as Nṛsiṁha, the half-man, half-lion incarnation, and killed the atheist king. Thus the Lord is within everything, and He creates everything by His different energies. Through His inconceivable powers He can appear at any place in order to favor His sincere devotee. Lord Nṛsiṁha appeared from within the pillar not by the order of the atheist king but by the wish of His devotee Prahlāda. An atheist cannot order the Lord to appear, but the Lord will appear anywhere and everywhere to show mercy to His devotee.

Of course, the Lord has sufficient energies and agents who can vanquish atheists, but it pleases Him to personally favor a devotee. Therefore He descends as an incarnation. Actually, He descends only to favor His devotees and not for any other purpose.3f:T428,Above the \u003cem\u003emadhyama-adhikārī\u003c/em\u003e is the \u003cem\u003eutt"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"ama-adhikārī,\u003c/em\u003e who sees everything in relation to the Supreme Lord.

Vedic truths are coming in disciplic succession from the Lord to Brahmā, from Brahmā to Nārada, from Nārada to Vyāsa, and from Vyāsa to his many disciples.

The individual sparks of the supreme whole (the Lord) possess almost eighty percent of the known qualities of the whole, but they are not quantitatively equal to the Supreme Lord. These qualities are present in minute quantity, for the living entity is but a minute part and parcel of the supreme whole. To use another example, the quantity of salt present in a drop is never comparable to the quantity of salt present in the complete ocean, but the salt present in the drop is qualitatively equal in chemical composition to all the salt present in the ocean.

In the previous \u003cem\u003emantras\u003c/em\u003e it has already been discussed that no living being – not even the powerful demigods – can surpass the Supreme Being in any respect. Therefore \u003cem\u003eekatvam\u003c/em\u003e does not mean that a living being is equal in all respects to the Supreme Lord. It does, however, indicate that in a broader sense there is one interest, just as in a family the interest of all members is one, or in a nation the national interest is one, although there are many different individual citizens. Since the living entities are all members of the same supreme family, their interest and that of the Supreme Being are not different. Every living being is the son of the Supreme Being. As stated in the \u003ca href=\"/en/library/bg/7/5/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e (7.5)\u003c/a\u003e, all living creatures throughout the universe – including birds, reptiles, ants, aquatics, trees and so on – are emanations of the marginal potency of the Supreme Lord. Therefore all of them belong to the family of the Supreme Being. There is no clash of interest.43:T528,The spiritual entities are meant for enjoyment, as stated in the \u003cem\u003eVedānta-sūtra\u003c/em\u003e (1.1.12): \u003cem\u003eānanda-mayo ’bhyāsāt\u003c/em\u003e. By nature and constitution, every living being – including the Supreme Lord and each of His parts and parcels – is meant for eternal enjoyment. The living beings who are encaged in the material tabernacle are constantly seeking enjoyment, but they are seeking it on the wrong platform. Apart from the material platform is the spiritual platform, where the Supreme Being enjoys Himself with His innumerable associates.

We are all meant to join Him and enjoy life with one transcendental interest and without any clash. That is the highest platform of spiritual interest, and as soon as one realizes this perfect form of oneness, there can be no question of illusion (\u003cem\u003emoha\u003c/em\u003e) or lamentation (\u003cem\u003eśoka\u003c/em\u003e).44:T4b8,In the \u003cem\u003eBrahma-saṁhitā\u003c/em\u003e (5.1) there is a similar description of the Supreme Lord. He is described there as \u003cem\u003esac-cid-ānanda-vigraha,\u003c/em\u003e which means that He is the eternal form fully representing transcendental existence, knowledge and bliss. As such, He does not require a separate body or mind, as we do in material existence. The Vedic literature clearly states that the Lord’s transcendental body is completely different from ours; thus He is sometimes described as formless. This means that He has no form like ours and that He is devoid of a form we can conceive of. In the \u003cem\u003eBrahma-saṁhitā\u003c/em\u003e (5.32) it is further stated that with each and every part of His body He can do the work of the other senses. This means that the Lord can walk with His hands, accept things with His legs, see with His hands and feet, eat with His eyes, etc. In the \u003cem\u003eśruti-mantras\u003c/em\u003e it is also said that although the Lord has no hands and legs like ours, He has a different type of hands and legs, by which He can accept all that we offer Him and run faster than anyone. These points are confirmed in this eighth \u003cem\u003emantra\u003c/em\u003e through the use of words like \u003cem\u003eśukram\u003c/em\u003e (“omnipotent”).45:T567,The Lord’s worshipable form (\u003cem\u003earcā-vigraha\u003c/em\u003e), which is installed in temples by authorized \u003cem\u003eācāryas\u003c/em\u003e who have realized the Lord in terms of Mantra Seven, is nondifferent from the original form of the Lord.

Similarly, the \u003cem\u003earcā-vigraha\u003c/em\u003e worshiped in temples is also an expanded form of the Lord. By worshiping the \u003cem\u003earcā-vigraha,\u003c/em\u003e one can at once approach the Lord, who accepts the service of a devotee by His omnipotent energy. The \u003cem\u003earcā-vigraha\u003c/em\u003e of the Lord descends at the request of the \u003cem\u003eācāryas,\u003c/em\u003e the holy teachers, and works exactly in the original way of the Lord by virtue of the Lord’s omnipotence. Foolish people who have no knowledge of \u003cem\u003eŚrī Īśopaniṣad\u003c/em\u003e or any of the other \u003cem\u003eśruti-mantras\u003c/em\u003e consider the \u003cem\u003earcā-vigraha,\u003c/em\u003e which is worshiped by pure devotees, to be made of material elements. This form may be seen as material by the imperfect eyes of foolish people or \u003cem\u003ekaniṣṭha-adhikārīs,\u003c/em\u003e but such people do not know that the Lord, being omnipotent and omniscient, can transform matter into spirit and spirit into matter, as He desires.46:T58d,Ordinarily the living being does not know what to ask from the Lord, nor which post to seek. When the living being comes to know his constitutional position, however, he asks to be accepted into the transcendental association of the Lord in order to render transcendental loving service unto Him. Unfortunately, living beings under the influence of material nature ask for many other things, and they are described in the \u003ca href=\"/en/library/bg/2/41/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e (2.41)\u003c/a\u003e as having divided, or splayed, intelligence. Spiritual intelligence is one, but mundane intelligence is diverse. In \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e (7.5.30–31) it is stated that those who are captivated by the temporary beauties of the external energy forget the real aim of life, which is to go back to Godhead. Forgetting this, one tries to adjust things by various plans and programs, but this is like chewing what has already been chewed. Nonetheless, the Lord is so kind that He allows the forgetful living entity to continue in this way without interference.

The sun extracts moisture from many untouchable places on the earth, yet it remains pure. In fact, it purifies obnoxious things by virtue of its sterilizing powers.

As Lord Kṛṣṇa states in the \u003ca href=\"/en/library/bg/8/16/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e (8.16)\u003c/a\u003e:4e:T468,\u003cem\u003eŚrī Īśopaniṣad\u003c/em\u003e points out that one who worships the demigods and attains to their material planets still remains in the darkest region of the universe. The whole universe is covered by the gigantic material elements; it is just like a coconut covered by a shell and half-filled with water. Since its covering is airtight, the darkness within is dense, and therefore the sun and the moon are required for illumination. Outside the universe is the vast and unlimited \u003cem\u003ebrahma-jyotir\u003c/em\u003e expansion, which is filled with Vaikuṇṭha-lokas. The biggest and highest planet in the \u003cem\u003ebrahma-jyotir\u003c/em\u003e is Kṛṣṇaloka, or Goloka Vṛndāvana, where the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself, resides. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa never leaves Kṛṣṇaloka. Although He dwells there with His eternal associates, He is omnipresent throughout the complete material and spiritual cosmic manifestations. This fact has already been explained in Mantra Four. The Lord is present everywhere, just like the sun, yet He is situated in one place, just as the sun is situated in its own undeviating orbit.4f:T559,The problems of life cannot be solved simply by going to the moon planet or to some other planet above or below it.

There are many pseudo worshipers who become religionists only for the sake of name and fame. Such pseudo religionists do not wish to get out of this universe and reach the spiritual sky. They only want to maintain the status quo in the material world under the garb of worshiping the Lord. The atheists and impersonalists lead such foolish pseudo religionists into the darkest regions by preaching the cult of atheism. The atheist directly denies the existence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the impersonalists support the atheists by stressing the impersonal aspect of the Supreme Lord.

It is said that He can run faster than anyone. Those who are running after other planets are certainly persons, and if the Lord can run faster than all of them, how can He be impersonal? The impersonal conception of the Supreme Lord is another form of ignorance, arising from an imperfect conception of the Absolute Truth.50:T44b,The ignorant pseudo religionists and the manufacturers of so-called incarnations who directly violate the Vedic injunctions are liable to enter into the darkest region of the universe because they mislead those who follow them. These impersonalists generally pose themselves as incarnations of God to foolish persons who have no knowledge of Vedic wisdom. If such foolish men have any knowledge at all, it is more dangerous in their hands than ignorance itself. Such impersonalists do not even worship the demigods according to the scriptural recommendations. In the scriptures there are recommendations for worshiping demigods under certain circumstances, but at the same time these scriptures state that there is normally no need for this. In the \u003ca href=\"/en/library/bg/7/23/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e (7.23)\u003c/a\u003e it is clearly stated t"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"hat the results derived from worshiping the demigods are not permanent.

In other words, the path of salvation from the material clutches fully depends on the principles of knowledge and detachment gained from serving the Lord. The pseudo religionists have neither knowledge nor detachment from material affairs, for most of them want to live in the golden shackles of material bondage under the shadow of philanthropic activities disguised as religious principles. By a false display of religious sentiments, they present a show of devotional service while indulging in all sorts of immoral activities.

And if we wish to remain on this wretched planet with our planning commissions and our stopgap political adjustments, we can certainly do that also.53:T4fb,Nowhere in authentic scriptures is it said that one will ultimately reach the same goal by doing anything or worshiping anyone.

A person who has purchased a ticket for Calcutta can reach Calcutta, but not Bombay. But the so-called spiritual masters say that any and all paths will take one to the supreme goal.

Thus from Nārāyaṇa, Brahmā was born. Nārāyaṇa created all the Prajāpatis. Nārāyaṇa created Indra. Nārāyaṇa created the eight Vasus. Nārāyaṇa created the eleven Rudras.

These desires are represented in the various species of life, from germs to the most perfected material bodies, those of Brahmā and the demigods.

One must perform these two different functions along parallel lines, because a conditioned soul cannot give up the maintenance of his body. The proportion of activities for maintenance of the body decreases, however, in proportion to the increase in devotional service. As long as the proportion of devotional service does not come to the right point, there is a chance for an occasional exhibition of worldliness. But it should be noted that such worldliness cannot continue for long because, by the grace of the Lord, such imperfections will come to an end very shortly. Therefore the path of devotional service is the only right path.

The human being is given all facilities for a comfortable life by the laws of nature because the human form of life is more important and valuable than animal life. Why is man given a better life than that of the swine and other animals? Why is a highly placed government servant given better facilities than those of an ordinary clerk? The answer is that a highly placed officer has to discharge duties of a higher nature. Similarly, the duties human beings have to perform are higher than those of animals, who are always engaged in simply feeding their hungry stomachs. Yet the modern soul-killing civilization has only increased the problems of the hungry stomach. When we approach a polished animal in the form of a modern civilized man and ask him to take interest in self-realization, he will say that he simply wants to work to satisfy his stomach and that there is no need of self-realization for a hungry man. The laws of nature are so cruel, however, that despite his denunciation of the need for self-realization and his eagerness to work hard to fill his stomach, he is always threatened by unemployment.b7:T66c,In the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e (6.41"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"–43) it is stated that a man who enters upon the path of self-realization but does not complete the process, despite having sincerely tried to realize his relationship with God, is given a chance to appear in a family of \u003cem\u003eśuci\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eśrīmat.\u003c/em\u003e The word \u003cem\u003eśuci\u003c/em\u003e indicates a spiritually advanced \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa,\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eśrīmat\u003c/em\u003e indicates a \u003cem\u003evaiśya,\u003c/em\u003e a member of the mercantile community.

He is described there as \u003cem\u003esac-cid-ānanda-vigraha,\u003c/em\u003e which means that He is the eternal form fully representing transcendental existence, knowledge and bliss. As such, He does not require a separate body or mind, as we do in material existence. The Vedic literature clearly states that the Lord’s transcendental body is completely different from ours; thus He is sometimes described as formless. This means that He has no form like ours and that He is devoid of a form we can conceive of. In the \u003cem\u003eBrahma-saṁhitā\u003c/em\u003e (5.32) it is further stated that with each and every part of His body He can do the work of the other senses. This means that the Lord can walk with His hands, accept things with His legs, see with His hands and feet, eat with His eyes, etc. In the \u003cem\u003eśruti-mantras\u003c/em\u003e it is also said that although the Lord has no hands and legs like ours, He has a different type of hands and legs, by which He can accept all that we offer Him and run faster than anyone. These points are confirmed in this eighth \u003cem\u003emantra\u003c/em\u003e through the use of words like \u003cem\u003eśukram\u003c/em\u003e (“omnipotent”).bf:T567,The Lord’s worshipable form (\u003cem\u003e"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"arcā-vigraha\u003c/em\u003e), which is installed in temples by authorized \u003cem\u003eācāryas\u003c/em\u003e who have realized the Lord in terms of Mantra Seven, is nondifferent from the original form of the Lord. The Lord’s original form is that of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and Śrī Kṛṣṇa expands Himself into an unlimited number of forms, such as Baladeva, Rāma, Nṛsiṁha and Varāha. All of these forms are one and the same Personality of Godhead. Similarly, the \u003cem\u003earcā-vigraha\u003c/em\u003e worshiped in temples is also an expanded form of the Lord. By worshiping the \u003cem\u003earcā-vigraha,\u003c/em\u003e one can at once approach the Lord, who accepts the service of a devotee by His omnipotent energy. The \u003cem\u003earcā-vigraha\u003c/em\u003e of the Lord descends at the request of the \u003cem\u003eācāryas,\u003c/em\u003e the holy teachers, and works exactly in the original way of the Lord by virtue of the Lord’s omnipotence.

This form may be seen as material by the imperfect eyes of foolish people or \u003cem\u003ekaniṣṭha-adhikārīs,\u003c/em\u003e but such people do not know that the Lord, being omnipotent and omniscient, can transform matter into spirit and spirit into matter, as He desires.c0:T808,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Only the Supreme Lord is self-sufficient. When Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared on earth five thousand years ago, He displayed His full manifestation as the Personality of Godhead through His various activities. In His childhood He killed many powerful demons, such as Aghāsura, Bakāsura and Śakaṭāsura, and there was no question of His having acquired such power through any extraneous endeavor. He lifted Govardhana Hill without ever practicing weight-lifting. He danced with the \u003cem\u003egopīs\u003c/em\u003e without social restriction and without reproach. Although the \u003cem\u003egopīs\u003c/em\u003e approached Him with a paramour’s feelings of love, the relationship between the \u003cem\u003egopīs\u003c/em\u003e and Lord Kṛṣṇa was worshiped even by Lord Caitanya, who was a strict \u003cem\u003esannyāsī\u003c/em\u003e and rigid follower of disciplinary regulations. To confirm that the Lord is always pure and uncontaminated, \u003cem\u003eŚrī Īśopaniṣad\u003c/em\u003e describes Him as \u003cem\u003eśuddham\u003c/em\u003e (antiseptic) and \u003cem\u003eapāpa-viddham\u003c/em\u003e (prophylactic). He is antiseptic in the sense that even an impure thing can become purified just by touching Him. The word “prophylactic” refers to the power of His association. As mentioned in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e (9.30–31), a devotee may appear to be \u003cem\u003esu-durācāra,\u003c/em\u003e not well behaved, in the beginning, but he should be accepted as pure because he is on the right path. This is due to the prophylactic nature of the Lord’s association. The Lord is also \u003cem\u003eapāpa-viddham\u003c/em\u003e because sin cannot touch Him. Even if He acts in a way that appears to be sinful, such actions are all-good, for there is no question of His being affected by sin. Because in all circumstances He is \u003cem\u003eśuddham,\u003c/em\u003e most purified, He is often compared to the sun. The sun extracts moisture from many untouchable places on the earth, yet it remains pure. In fact, it purifies obnoxious things by virtue of its sterilizing powers.

He asked from Brahmā many benedictions in hopes of indirectly fulfilling his desire to become immortal. Since Brahmā told him that he could not grant the gift of immortality, Hiraṇyakaśipu requested that he not be killed by any man, animal, god or any other living being within the 8,400,000 species. He also asked that he not die on land, in the air or water, or by any weapon. In this way Hiraṇyakaśipu foolishly thought these guarantees would save him from death. Ultimately, however, although Brahmā granted him all these benedictions, he was killed by the Personality of Godhead in the form of Nṛsiṁha, the Lord’s half-lion, half-man incarnation, and no weapon was used to kill him, for he was killed by the Lord’s nails. Nor was he killed on the land, in the air or in the water, for he was killed on the lap of that wonderful living being, Nṛsiṁha, who was beyond his conception.c3:T7f7,Therefore the culture of \u003cem\u003evidyā,\u003c/em\u003e or transcendental knowledge, is essential for the human being.

Unrestricted sense enjoyment in this bodily condition is the path of ignorance and death. The living entities are not without spiritual senses; every living being in his original, spiritual form has all the senses, which are now materially manifested, being covered by the material body and mind. The activities of the material senses are perverted reflections of the activities of the original, spiritual senses. In his diseased condition, the spirit soul engages in material activities under the material covering. Real sense enjoyment is possible only when the disease of materialism is removed. In our pure spiritual form, free from all material contamination, real enjoyment of the senses is possible. A patient must regain his health before he can truly enjoy sense pleasure again. Thus the aim of human life should not be to enjoy perverted sense enjoyment but to cure the material disease. Aggravation of the material disease is no sign of knowledge, but a sign of \u003cem\u003eavidyā,\u003c/em\u003e ignorance. For good health, a person should not increase his fever from 105 degrees to 107 degrees but should reduce his temperature to the normal 98.6. That should be the aim of human life. The modern trend of material civilization is to increase the temperature of the feverish material condition, which has reached the point of 107 degrees in the form of atomic energy.

Nārāyaṇa created the twelve Ādityas.” Since Nārāyaṇa is a plenary manifestation of Lord Kṛṣṇa, Nārāyaṇa and Kṛṣṇa are one and the same. The \u003cem\u003eNārāyaṇa Upaniṣad\u003c/em\u003e (4) also states, “Devakī’s son [Kṛṣṇa] is the Supreme Lord.” The identity of Nārāyaṇa with the supreme cause has also been accepted and confirmed by Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya, even though Śaṅkara does not belong to the Vaiṣṇava, or personalist, cult. The \u003cem\u003eAtharva Veda\u003c/em\u003e (\u003cem\u003eMahā Upaniṣad\u003c/em\u003e 1) also states, “Only Nārāyaṇa existed in the beginning, when neither Brahmā, nor Śiva, nor fire, nor water, nor stars, nor sun, nor moon existed. The Lord does not remain alone but creates as He desires.” Kṛṣṇa Himself states in the \u003cem\u003eMokṣa-dharma,\u003c/em\u003e “I created the Prajāpatis and the Rudras. They do not have complete knowledge of Me because they are covered by My illusory energy.” It is also stated in the \u003cem\u003eVarāha Purāṇa:\u003c/em\u003e “Nārāyaṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and from Him the four-headed Brahmā was manifested, as well as Rudra, who later became omniscient.”"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"9a:[\"$\",\"div\",\"94119-purport,94119-purport\",{\"className\":\"av-purport\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"h3\",null,{\"className\":\"text-center em:leading-5 em:text-xl font-bold em:mb-4\",\"children\":\"Purport\"}],[[\"$\",\"$L62\",\"child-94123\",{\"child\":\"$2b:props:children:0:props:children:props:page:child_items:1:children:13:child_items:3:children:0\",\"hasId\":true,\"children\":[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify\",\"children\":[\"The system of hearing from undisturbed authorities is approved in this \",[\"$\",\"em\",\"1\",{\"children\":\"mantra.\"}],\" Unless one hears from a bona fide \",[\"$\",\"em\",\"3\",{\"children\":\"ācārya,\"}],\" who is never disturbed by the changes of the material world, one cannot have the real key to transcendental knowledge.

Social status, mental development, cleanliness, austerity, nourishment and the struggle for existence are all for the maintenance of the body. The self-realization part of one’s activities is executed in one’s occupation as a devotee of the Lord, and one performs actions in that connection also. One must perform these two different functions along parallel lines, because a conditioned soul cannot give up the maintenance of his body. The proportion of activities for maintenance of the body decreases, however, in proportion to the increase in devotional service. As long as the proportion of devotional service does not come to the right point, there is a chance for an occasional exhibition of worldliness. But it should be noted that such worldliness cannot continue for long because, by the grace of the Lord, such imperfections will come to an end very shortly. Therefore the path of devotional service is the only right path. If one is on the right path, even an occasional occurrence of worldliness does not hamper one in the advancement of self-realization.”cc:T6a6,All the facilities suggested in this \u003cem\u003emantra\u003c/em\u003e can be easily obtained by constant contac"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"t with the personal feature of the Absolute Truth.
