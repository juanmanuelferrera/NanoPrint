Prabuddha tells Mahārāja Nimi, “My dear King, please know for certain that in the material world there is no happiness. It is simply a mistake to think that there is happiness here, because this place is full of nothing but miserable conditions. Any person who is seriously desirous of achieving real happiness must seek out a bona fide spiritual master and take shelter of him by initiation. The qualification of a spiritual master is that he must have realized the conclusion of the scriptures by deliberation and arguments and thus be able to convince others of these conclusions. Such great personalities who have taken shelter of the Supreme Godhead, leaving aside all material considerations, are to be understood as bona fide spiritual masters. Everyone should try to find such a bona fide spiritual master in order to fulfill his mission of life, which is to transfer himself to the plane of spiritual bliss.”</div></div><div id="bb1206811" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The purport is that one should not accept as a spiritual master someone who is fool number one, who has no direction according to the scriptural injunctions, whose character is doubtful, who does not follow the principles of devotional service, or who has not conquered the influence of the six sense-gratifying agents. The six agents of sense gratification are the tongue, the genitals, the belly, anger, the mind and words. Anyone who has practiced controlling these six is permitted to make disciples all over the world. To accept such a spiritual master is the crucial point for advancement in spiritual life. One who is fortunate enough to come under the shelter of a bona fide spiritual master is sure to traverse the path of spiritual salvation without any doubt.</div></div><div id="bb1206812" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">ACCEPTING INITIATION FROM THE SPIRITUAL MASTER AND RECEIVING<br /> INSTRUCTIONS FROM HIM</h2></div><div id="bb1206813" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Sage Prabuddha continued to speak to the king as follows: “My dear king, a disciple has to accept the spiritual master not only as spiritual master, but also as the representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the Supersoul. In other words, the disciple should accept the spiritual master as God, because he is the external manifestation of Kṛṣṇa. This is confirmed in every scripture, and a disciple should accept the spiritual master as such. One should learn <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> seriously and with all respect and veneration for the spiritual master. Hearing and speaking <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> is the religious process that elevates one to the platform of serving and loving the Supreme Personality of Godhead.”</div></div><div id="bb1206814" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The attitude of the disciple should be to satisfy the bona fide spiritual master.

Instead, he will simply create disturbances for the sincere students of devotional service.” Those who do not strictly follow the principles of revealed scriptures are generally called <em>sahajiyās –</em> those who have imagined everything to be cheap, who have their own concocted ideas, and who do not follow the scriptural injunctions.

An example of this is seen in Buddhist philosophy. Lord Buddha appeared in the family of a high-grade <em>kṣatriya</em> king, but his philosophy was not in accord with the Vedic conclusions and therefore was rejected. Under the patronage of a Hindu king, Mahārāja Aśoka, the Buddhist religion was spread all over India and the adjoining countries. However, after the appearance of the great stalwart teacher Śaṅkarācārya, this Buddhism was driven out beyond the borders of India.</div></div><div id="bb1206821" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The Buddhists or other religionists who do not care for revealed scriptures sometimes say that there are many devotees of Lord Buddha who show devotional service to Lord Buddha and who therefore should be considered devotees. In answer to this argument, Rūpa Gosvāmī says that the followers of Buddha cannot be accepted as devotees. Although Lord Buddha is accepted as an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa, the followers of such incarnations are not very advanced in their knowledge of the <em>Vedas.</em> To study the <em>Vedas</em> means to come to the conclusion of the supremacy of the Personality of Godhead. Therefore any religious principle that denies the supremacy of the Personality of Godhead is not accepted and is called atheism. Atheism means defying the authority of the <em>Vedas</em> and decrying the great <em>ācāryas</em> who teach Vedic scriptures for the benefit of the people in general.</div></div><div id="bb1206822" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Lord Buddha is accepted as an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa in the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</em> but in the same <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> it is stated that Lord Buddha appeared in order to bewilder the atheistic class of men. Therefore his philosophy is meant for bewildering the atheists and should not be accepted. If someone asks, “Why should Kṛṣṇa propagate atheistic principles?” the answer is that it was the desire of the Supreme Personality of Godhead to end the violence which was then being committed in the name of the <em>Vedas.</em> The so-called religionists were falsely using the <em>Vedas</em> to justify such violent acts as meat-eating, and Lord Buddha came to lead the fallen people away from such a false interpretation of the <em>Vedas.</em> Also, for the atheists Lord Buddha preached atheism so that they would follow him and thus be tricked into devotional service to Lord Buddha, or Kṛṣṇa.</div></div><div id="bb1206823" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">INQUIRING ABOUT ETERNAL RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLES</h2></div><div id="bb1206824" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <em>Nāradīya Purāṇa</em> it is said, “If one is actually very serious about devotional service, then all of his purposes will be served without any delay.”</div></div><div id="bb1206825" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">BEING PREPARED TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING MATERIAL FOR KṚṢṆA’S SATISFACTION</h2></div><div id="bb1206826" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <em>Padma Purāṇa</em> it is stated, “For one who has given up his material sense enjoyment and has accepted the principles of devotional service, the opulence of Viṣṇuloka [the kingdom of God] is awaiting.”</div></div><div id="bb1206827" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">RESIDING IN A SACRED PLACE</h2></div><div id="bb1206828" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <em>Skanda Purāṇa</em> it is also said that for a person who has lived in Dvārakā for six months, for one month, or even for one fortnight, there is awaiting elevation to the Vaikuṇṭha-lokas and all the profits of <em>sārūpya-mukti</em> (the privilege of having the same four-handed bodily features as Nārāyaṇa).</div></div><div id="bb1206829" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <em>Brahmā Purāṇa</em> it is said, “The transcendental significance of Puruṣottama-kṣetra, which is the eighty-square-mile field of Lord Jagannātha, cannot be properly described.

For example, it may be said that one should chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa <em>mantra</em> at least one hundred thousand times daily on his beads. But if this is not possible, then one must minimize his chanting according to his own capacity. Generally, we recommend our disciples to chant at least sixteen rounds on their <em>japa</em> beads daily, and this should be completed. But if one is not even able to chant sixteen rounds, then he must make it up the next day. He must be sure to keep his vow. If he does not strictly follow this out, then he is sure to be negligent. That is offensive in the service of the Lord. If we encourage offenses, we shall not be able to make progress in devotional service.

Similarly, in the <em>Viṣṇu-rahasya</em> there is a statement to the effect that one should prefer to embrace a snake, a tiger or an alligator rather than associate with persons who are worshipers of various demigods and who are impelled by material desire.</div></div><div id="bb1206840" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the scriptures it is instructed that one may worship a certain demigod if he is desirous of achieving some material gain.

For a beautiful wife, one may worship Umā, the wife of Lord Śiva, and for advanced education one may worship Sarasvatī. Similarly, there is a list in the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> for worshipers of all demigods according to different material desires. But all of these worshipers, although they appear to be very good devotees of the demigods, are still considered to be nondevotees.

So actually these persons who are worshipers of demigods have been condemned in the <em>Gītā.</em> It is described that due to their lusty desires they have lost their intelligence and have therefore taken to worshiping the different demigods. So in the <em>Viṣṇu-rahasya</em> these demigod worshipers are forcefully condemned by the statement that it is better to live with the most dangerous animals than to associate with these persons.</div></div><div id="bb1206842" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">NOT ACCEPTING UNFIT DISCIPLES, CONSTRUCTING MANY TEMPLES OR READING MANY BOOKS</h2></div><div id="bb1206843" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Another stricture is that a person may have many disciples, but he should not act in such a way that he will be obliged to any of them for some particular action or some favor.

Practically, if one very carefully reads <em>Bhagavad-gītā, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Teachings of Lord Caitanya</em> and this <em>Nectar of Devotion,</em> that will give him sufficient knowledge to understand the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

One who has accepted the <em>sannyāsa</em> order of life is forbidden to accept as a disciple anyone who is not fit. A <em>sannyāsī</em> should first of all examine whether a prospective student is sincerely seeking Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If he is not, he should not be accepted. However, Lord Caitanya’s causeless mercy is such that He advised all bona fide spiritual masters to speak about Kṛṣṇa consciousness everywhere. Therefore, in the line of Lord Caitanya even the <em>sannyāsīs</em> can speak about Kṛṣṇa consciousness everywhere, and if someone is seriously inclined to become a disciple, the <em>sannyāsī</em> always accepts him.</div></div><div id="bb1206845" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The one point is that without increasing the number of disciples, there is no propagation of the cult of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore, sometimes even at a risk, a <em>sannyāsī</em> in the line of Caitanya Mahāprabhu may accept even a person who is not thoroughly fit to become a disciple. Later on, by the mercy of such a bona fide spiritual master, the disciple is gradually elevated. However, if one increases the number of disciples simply for some prestige or false honor, he will surely fall down in the matter of executing Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div></div><div id="bb1206846" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Similarly, a bona fide spiritual master has no business reading many books simply to show his proficiency or to get popularity by lecturing in different places. One should avoid all these things. It is also stated that a <em>sannyāsī</em> should not be enthusiastic about constructing temples. We can see in the lives of various <em>ācāryas</em> in the line of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu that they are not very enthusiastic about constructing temples. However, if somebody comes forward to offer some service, the same reluctant <em>ācāryas</em> will encourage the building of costly temples by such servitors. For example, Rūpa Gosvāmī was offered a favor by Mahārāja Mānsiṅgh, the commander-in-chief of Emperor Akhbar, and Rūpa Gosvāmī instructed him to construct a large temple for Govindajī, which cost vast amounts of money.</div></div><div id="bb1206847" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So a bona fide spiritual master should not personally take any responsibility for constructing temples, but if someone has money and wants to spend it in the service of Kṛṣṇa, an <em>ācārya</em> like Rūpa Gosvāmī may utilize the devotee’s money to construct a nice, costly temple for the service of the Lord. Unfortunately, it happens that someone who is not fit to become a spiritual master may approach wealthy persons to contribute for temple constructions. If such money is utilized by unqualified spiritual masters for living comfortably in costly temples without actually doing any preaching work, this is not acceptable. In other words, a spiritual master needn’t be very enthusiastic for constructing temple buildings simply in the name of so-called spiritual advancement. Rather, his first and foremost activity should be to preach. In this connection, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī Mahārāja recommended that a spiritual master print books. If one has money, instead of constructing costly temples, one should spend his money for the publication of authorized books in different languages for propagating the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.</div></div><div id="bb1206848" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">STRAIGHTFORWARDNESS IN ORDINARY DEALINGS AND EQUILIBRIUM IN LOSS AND GAIN</h2></div><div id="bb1206849" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">There is a statement in the <em>Padma Purāṇa:</em> “Persons who are engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness should never be disturbed by some material gain or loss.
