Sometimes Lord Kṛṣṇa began to play by dressing Himself like a woman. Seeing this form, Uddhava said, “How wonderful it is that this woman is attracting my ecstatic love exactly as Lord Kṛṣṇa does.

His head is protected with a canopy of hair. There are the marks of Śrīvatsa on His chest, and He is holding His conch shell.

It is said therein, “Persons who are desirous of becoming great personalities must be decorated with the following qualities: truthfulness, cleanliness, mercy, perseverance, renunciation, peacefulness, simplicity, control of the senses, equilibrium of the mind, austerity, equality, forbearance, placidity, learning, knowledge, detachment, opulence, chivalry, influence, strength, memory, independence, tactfulness, luster, patience, kind-heartedness, ingenuity, gentility, mannerliness, determination, perfection in all knowledge, proper execution, possession of all objects of enjoyment, gravity, steadiness, faithfulness, fame, respectfulness and lack of false egotism.” Persons who are desiring to become great souls cannot be without any of the above qualities, so we can know for certain that these qualities are found in Lord Kṛṣṇa, the supreme soul.</div></div><div id="bb1207217" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Besides all of the above-mentioned fifty qualities, Lord Kṛṣṇa possesses five more, which are sometimes partially manifested in the persons of Lord Brahmā or Lord Śiva.

I am wondering how this boy could have taken His birth in a family of cowherd men.” Generally, when Lord Kṛṣṇa appears He does so in a family of <em>kṣatriyas</em> (kings), as did Lord Rāmacandra, and sometimes in a family of <em>brāhmaṇas.</em> But Kṛṣṇa accepted the role of son to Mahārāja Nanda, despite the fact that Nanda belonged to the <em>vaiśya</em> community. The business of the <em>vaiśya</em> community is trade, commerce and the protection of cows. Therefore his friend, who may have been born into a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> family, expressed his wonder at how such an exalted child could take birth in a family of <em>vaiśyas.</em> Anyway, he pointed out the auspicious signs on the body of Kṛṣṇa to the boy’s foster father.</div></div><div id="bb1207225" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">He continued, “This boy has a reddish luster in seven places – His eyes, the ends of His hands, the ends of His legs, His palate, His lips, His tongue and His nails. A reddish luster in these seven places is considered to be auspicious. Three parts of His body are very broad: His waist, forehead and chest. Three parts of His body are short: His neck, thighs and genitals. Three parts of His body are very deep: His voice, intelligence and navel. There is highness in five parts of His body: His nose, arms, ears, forehead and thighs.

In the Third Canto, second chapter, verse 13 of <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</em> there is a statement about this. “The Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His pleasing dress, appeared at the scene of the sacrificial arena when King Yudhiṣṭhira was performing the Rājasūya sacrifice. All important personalities from different parts of the universe had been invited to the sacrificial arena, and all of them, upon beholding Kṛṣṇa there, considered that the Creator had ended all of His craftsmanship in the creation of this particular body of Kṛṣṇa.”</div></div><div id="bb1207229" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">It is said that the transcendental body of Kṛṣṇa resembles the lotus flower in eight parts – namely, His face, His two eyes, His two hands, His navel and His two feet.

Therefore the transcendental influence of Kṛṣṇa is so great that it can defeat anyone. When Kṛṣṇa was present in the sacrificial arena of His enemy King Kaṁsa, the wrestlers present, although appreciating the softness of the body of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, were afraid and perturbed when they thought of engaging with Him in battle.</div></div><div id="bb1207233" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">5.  STRONG</h2></div><div id="bb1207234" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">A person who has extraordinary bodily strength is called <em>balīyān.</em> When Kṛṣṇa killed Ariṣṭāsura, some of the <em>gopīs</em> said, “My dear friends, just see how Kṛṣṇa has killed Ariṣṭāsura!

It appears from this statement that Kṛṣṇa can also speak and understand the languages of the animals. An old woman in Vṛndāvana, present at the time of Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes, once stated in surprise, “How wonderful it is that Kṛṣṇa, who owns the hearts of all the young girls of Vraja-bhūmi, can nicely speak the language of Vraja-bhūmi with the <em>gopīs,</em> while in Sanskrit He speaks with the demigods, and in the language of the animals He can even speak with the cows and buffalo! Similarly, in the language of the Kashmir province, and with the parrots and other birds, as well as in most common languages, Kṛṣṇa is so expressive!” She inquired from the <em>gopīs</em> as to how Kṛṣṇa had become so expert in speaking so many different types of languages.</div></div><div id="bb1207240" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">8.  TRUTHFUL</h2></div><div id="bb1207241" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">A person whose word of honor is never broken is called truthful.

After the battle was finished, when all the Pāṇḍavas had come home, Kuntī praised Kṛṣṇa because His promise was so nicely fulfilled. She said, “Even the sunshine may one day become cool and the moonshine one day become hot, but still Your promise will not fail.” Similarly, when Kṛṣṇa, along with Bhīma and Arjuna, went to challenge Jarāsandha, He plainly told Jarāsandha that He was the eternal Kṛṣṇa, present along with two of the Pāṇḍavas. The story is that both Kṛṣṇa and the Pāṇḍavas – in this case Bhīma and Arjuna – were <em>kṣatriyas</em> (warrior-kings). Jarāsandha was also a <em>kṣatriya</em> and was very charitable toward the <em>brāhmaṇas.</em> Thus Kṛṣṇa, who had planned to fight with Jarāsandha, went to him with Bhīma and Arjuna in the dress of <em>brāhmaṇas.</em> Jarāsandha, being very charitable toward the <em>brāhmaṇas,</em> asked them what they wanted and they expressed their desire to fight with him. Then Kṛṣṇa, dressed as a <em>brāhmaṇa,</em> declared Himself to be the same Kṛṣṇa who was the king’s eternal enemy.</div></div><div id="bb1207242" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">9.  PLEASING TALKER</h2></div><div id="bb1207243" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">A person who can speak sweetly even with his enemy just to pacify him is called a pleasing talker.

When Kṛṣṇa politely bade His father, Nanda Mahārāja, to stop the ritualistic offering of sacrifice to the rain-god, Indra, a wife of one village cowherd man became captivated. She later thus described the speaking of Kṛṣṇa to her friends: “Kṛṣṇa was speaking to His father so politely and gently that it was as if He were pouring nectar into the ears of all present there.

In other words, Brahmā first received the Vedic education from Kṛṣṇa, as the clouds receive water from the ocean. That Vedic education or instruction which was spoken by Brahmā to the world was then reposed upon the mountain of Sāndīpani Muni. Sāndīpani Muni’s instructions to Kṛṣṇa are like a reservoir of water on the mountain, which flows as a river and goes again to mix with the source, the ocean of Kṛṣṇa.” To be more clear, the idea is that Kṛṣṇa actually cannot be instructed by anyone, just as the ocean does not receive water from any source but itself. It only appears that the rivers are pouring water into the ocean. So it is clear that Brahmā received his education from Kṛṣṇa, and from Brahmā, via the disciplic succession, this Vedic instruction was distributed. Sāndīpani Muni is likened to the river which is flowing down again to that same original ocean of Kṛṣṇa.</div></div><div id="bb1207252" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The Siddhas, the inhabitants of Siddhaloka, where all are born with fully developed mystic powers, and the Cāraṇas, the inhabitants of a similar planet, pray to Kṛṣṇa as follows: “My Lord Govinda, the goddess of learning is decorated with fourteen kinds of educational ornaments, her intelligence is all-pervading within the four departments of the <em>Vedas,</em> her attention is always on the lawbooks given by great sages like Manu, and she is appareled in six kinds of expert knowledge – namely, Vedic evidence, grammar, astrology, rhetoric, vocabulary and logic. Her constant friends are the supplements of the <em>Vedas,</em> the <em>Purāṇas,</em> and she is decorated with the final conclusion of all education.

Being self-sufficient, Kṛṣṇa does not require the service of any living entity, although He has many devotees. It is because Kṛṣṇa is so kind and merciful that He gives everyone the opportunity to serve Him, as though He required the service of His devotees.</div></div><div id="bb1207254" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Regarding His moral principles, it is stated in <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> that Kṛṣṇa is ruling over Vṛndāvana as death personified to the thieves, as pleasing bliss to the pious, as the most beautiful Cupid to the young girls and as the most munificent personality to the poor men. He is as refreshing as the full moon to His friends, and to His opponents He is the annihilating fire generated from Lord Śiva. Kṛṣṇa is therefore the most perfect moralist in His reciprocal dealings with different kinds of persons. When He is death personified to the thieves, it is not that He is without moral principles or that He is cruel; He is still kind, because to punish thieves with death is to exhibit the highest quality of moral principles. In <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> also, Kṛṣṇa says that He deals with different kinds of persons according to their dealings with Him. Kṛṣṇa’s dealings with devotees and with nondevotees, although different, are equally good.

Therefore, when the untouchable king seized the city of Mathurā, Kṛṣṇa did not think it wise to kill him directly with His own hand. Still the king had to be killed, and therefore Kṛṣṇa decided with fine discretion that He should flee from the battlefield so that the untouchable king would chase Him. He could then lead the king to the mountain where Mucukunda was lying asleep. Mucukunda had received a benediction from Kārttikeya to the effect that when he awoke from his sleep, whomever he might see would at once be burnt to ashes. Therefore Kṛṣṇa thought it wise to lead the untouchable king to that cave so that the king’s presence would awaken Mucukunda and he would at once be burnt to ashes.</div></div><div id="bb1207258" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">13.  GENIUS</h2></div><div id="bb1207259" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">A person is called a genius when he can refute any kind of opposing element with newer and newer arguments.

Yāminyām</em> means “at night,” and <em>uṣitaḥ</em> means “pass.” Kṛṣṇa, however, divided the word <em>yāminyāmuṣitaḥ</em> into two separate words, namely, <em>yāminyā</em> and <em>muṣitaḥ.</em> By dividing this word into two, it came out to mean that He was kidnapped by Yāminī, or night. Kṛṣṇa therefore replied to Rādhārāṇī, “My dear Rādhārāṇī, is it possible that night can kidnap Me?” In this way He was answering all of the questions of Rādhārāṇī so cunningly that He gladdened this dearest of the <em>gopīs.</em></div></div><div id="bb1207264" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">14.  ARTISTIC</h2></div><div id="bb1207265" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">One who can talk and dress himself very artistically is called <em>vidagdha.</em> This exemplary characteristic was visible in the personality of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

About the expertise of Kṛṣṇa there is a statement in the Tenth Canto, fifty-ninth chapter, verse 17 of <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</em> wherein Śukadeva Gosvāmī tells Mahārāja Parīkṣit, “O best of the Kurus, Śrī Kṛṣṇa cut to pieces all the different weapons used by different fighters.” Formerly, fighting was done by releasing different kinds of arrows. One party would release a certain arrow, and the other party had to defeat it by counteracting it with another arrow. For example, one party might release an arrow that would cause water to pour from the sky, and to counteract this the opposing party would have to release an arrow that could immediately turn the water into clouds. So from this statement it appears that Kṛṣṇa was very expert in counteracting the enemy’s arrows. Similarly, at the <em>rāsa</em> dance, each and every <em>gopī</em> requested that Kṛṣṇa individually become her partner, and Kṛṣṇa immediately expanded Himself into so many Kṛṣṇas in order to be coupled with each and every <em>gopī.</em> The result was that each <em>gopī</em> found Kṛṣṇa by her side.</div></div><div id="bb1207270" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">17.  GRATEFUL</h2></div><div id="bb1207271" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Any person who is conscious of his friend’s beneficent activities and never forgets his service is called grateful.

So to anyone who is constantly engaged in addressing the Lord and His energy, we can imagine how much the Supreme Lord is obliged. It is impossible for the Lord to ever forget such a devotee. It is clearly stated in this verse that anyone who addresses the Lord immediately attracts the attention of the Lord, who always remains obliged to him.</div></div><div id="bb1207273" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Another instance of Kṛṣṇa’s feeling of obligation is stated in connection with His dealings with Jāmbavān.

When the Lord again appeared as Lord Kṛṣṇa, He married Jāmbavān’s daughter and paid him all the respect that is usually given to superiors. Any honest person is obliged to his friend if some service has been rendered unto him.

As far as the Lord’s determination is concerned, there is an example in His dealings in the <em>Hari-vaṁśa.</em> This is in connection with Lord Kṛṣṇa’s fighting the king of heaven, Indra, who was forcibly deprived of the <em>pārijāta</em> flower. <em>Pārijāta</em> is a kind of lotus flower grown on the heavenly planets. Once, Satyabhāmā, one of Kṛṣṇa’s queens, wanted that lotus flower, and Kṛṣṇa promised to deliver it; but Indra refused to part with his <em>pārijāta</em> flower. Therefore there was a great fight, with Kṛṣṇa and the Pāṇḍavas on one side and all of the demigods on the other. Ultimately, Kṛṣṇa defeated all of them and took the <em>pārijāta</em> flower, which He presented to His queen. So, in regard to that occurrence, Kṛṣṇa told Nārada Muni, “My dear great sage of the demigods, now you can declare to the devotees in general, and to the nondevotees in particular, that in this matter of taking the <em>pārijāta</em> flower, all the demigods – the Gandharvas, the Nāgas, the demon Rākṣasas, the Yakṣas, the Pannagas – tried to defeat Me, but none could make Me break My promise to My queen.”</div></div><div id="bb1207276" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">There is another promise by Kṛṣṇa in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> to the effect that His devotee will never be vanquished.

Kṛṣṇa, however, protected all of the citizens and animals of Vṛndāvana by lifting Govardhana Hill, which served as an umbrella. After the incident was over, Indra surrendered to Kṛṣṇa with many prayers, in which he admitted, “By Your lifting Govardhana Hill and protecting the citizens of Vṛndāvana, You have kept Your promise that Your devotees are never to be vanquished.”</div></div><div id="bb1207279" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">19.  EXPERT JUDGE OF TIME AND CIRCUMSTANCES</h2></div><div id="bb1207280" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Kṛṣṇa was very expert in dealing with people according to circumstances, country, time and paraphernalia.

For example, with our naked eye we perceive the sun globe simply as some glaring substance, but when we see through authorized books of science and other literature, we can understand how much greater the sun globe is than this earth and how powerful it is. So seeing things through the naked eye is not actually seeing. Seeing things through the authorized books or authorized teachers is the correct way to see. So, although Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and can see all that is past, present and future, to teach the people in general He used to always refer to the scriptures. For example, in <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> although Kṛṣṇa was speaking as the supreme authority, He still mentioned and quoted <em>Vedānta-sūtra</em> as authority. There is a statement in <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> wherein a person jokingly says that Kṛṣṇa, the enemy of Kaṁsa, is known as the seer through the <em>śāstras.</em> In order to establish His authority, however, He is now engaged in seeing the <em>gopīs,</em> whereby the <em>gopīs</em> are becoming maddened.</div></div><div id="bb1207283" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">21.  PURE</h2></div><div id="bb1207284" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">There are two kinds of supreme purity.

A person who possesses either of these qualities is called supremely pure.

Kṛṣṇa is the supreme deliverer among all deliverers. Undoubtedly there are great demigods like Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā, but their positions as deliverers depend always upon the mercy of Kṛṣṇa.” Therefore Vidura advised his elder brother, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, to concentrate his mind and worship only Kṛṣṇa. If one simply chants the holy name of Kṛṣṇa, this holy name will rise within one’s heart like the powerful sun and will immediately dissipate all the darkness of ignorance. Vidura advised Dhṛtarāṣṭra to therefore think always of Kṛṣṇa so that the volumes of contaminations due to sinful activities would be washed off immediately. In <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> also Kṛṣṇa is addressed by Arjuna as <em>paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitram</em><em> –</em> the supreme pure.

Whenever they would meet, Śiśupāla would try to insult Kṛṣṇa and call Him ill names as much as possible. In the arena of the Rājasūya sacrifice of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, when Śiśupāla began to call Lord Kṛṣṇa ill names, Kṛṣṇa did not care and remained silent. Some of the people at the arena were prepared to kill Śiśupāla, but Kṛṣṇa restricted them. He was so forgiving.

This was certainly an insult to the universal mother, Sītā, and Lord Rāmacandra was immediately prepared to kill the crow. But because later on the crow bowed down before the Lord, the Lord excused his offense. Śrī Yāmunācārya further says in his prayer that the forgiving power of Lord Kṛṣṇa is even greater than that of Lord Rāmacandra, because Śiśupāla was always in the habit of insulting Kṛṣṇa – not only in one lifetime but continually throughout three lives. Still, Kṛṣṇa was so kind that He gave Śiśupāla the salvation of merging into His existence.

In other words, although in the spiritual kingdom, the abode of Kṛṣṇa, everything is wonderfully opulent, still when Kṛṣṇa was in Dvārakā His charity exceeded the opulences of Goloka Vṛndāvana. Wherever Kṛṣṇa is present, the limitless opulence of Goloka Vṛndāvana is automatically present.</div></div><div id="bb1207311" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">It is also stated that while Lord Kṛṣṇa was living in Dvārakā He expanded Himself into 16,108 forms, and each and every expansion resided in a palace with a queen. Not only was Kṛṣṇa happily living with His queens in those palaces, but He was giving in charity from each palace an aggregate number of 13,054 cows completely decorated with nice clothing and ornaments. From each of Kṛṣṇa’s 16,108 palaces, these cows were given daily. This means that 13,054 multiplied by 16,108 cows were being given in charity by Kṛṣṇa every day. No one can estimate the value of such a large number of cows given in charity, but that was the system of Kṛṣṇa’s daily affairs while He was reigning in Dvārakā.</div></div><div id="bb1207312" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">30.  RELIGIOUS</h2></div><div id="bb1207313" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">A person who personally practices the tenets of religion as they are enjoined in the <em>śāstras</em> and who also teaches others the same principles is called religious. Simply professing a kind of faith is not a sign of religiousness. One must act according to religious principles, and by his personal example he should teach others. Such a person is to be understood as religious.</div></div><div id="bb1207314" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">When Kṛṣṇa was present on this planet, there was no irreligion. In this connection, Nārada Muni once addressed Kṛṣṇa jokingly, “My dear Lord of the cowherd boys, Your bulls [bulls are the representation of religion], while eating grass from the pasturing ground and moving on their four legs, have certainly eaten up all the grass of irreligion!” In other words, by the grace of Kṛṣṇa, religious principles were so well cared for that hardly any irreligious activities could be found.</div></div><div id="bb1207315" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">It is said that because Kṛṣṇa was constantly performing various types of sacrifices and was inviting the demigods from the higher planetary systems, the demigods were almost always absent from their consorts. Therefore the wives of the demigods, regretting the absence of their husbands, began to pray for the appearance of Lord Buddha, Kṛṣṇa’s ninth incarnation, who appears in the age of Kali. In other words, instead of being pleased that Lord Kṛṣṇa had come, they began to pray for Lord Buddha, who is the ninth incarnation, because Lord Buddha stopped the ritualistic ceremonies and sacrifices recommended in the <em>Vedas</em> in order to discourage animal-killing. The demigods’ wives thought that if Lord Buddha appeared, all kinds of sacrifices would be stopped and thus their husbands would not be invited to such ceremonies and would not be separated from them.</div></div><div id="bb1207316" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Sometimes it is inquired, “Why don’t the demigods from higher planetary systems come to this earth planet nowadays?” The plain answer is that since Lord Buddha appeared and began to deprecate the performance of sacrifice in order to stop animal-killing on this planet, the process of offering sacrifices has been stopped, and the demigods do not care to come here anymore.</div></div><div class="mt-10 flex justify-between"><a href="/en/library/nod/20/" class="inline-flex font-sans items-center px-4 py-2 mr-4 text-base font-medium bg-vb-header-top bg-opacity-30 border border-vb-header-top border-opacity-30 rounded-lg hover:bg-opacity-50"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 448 512" class="mr-2" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M257.5 445.1l-22.2 22.2c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0L7 273c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9L201.4 44.7c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0l22.2 22.2c9.5 9.5 9.3 25-.4 34.3L136.6 216H424c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24v32c0 13.3-10.7 24-24 24H136.6l120.5 114.8c9.8 9.3 10 24.8.4 34.3z"></path></svg>CHAPTER TWENTY</a><a href="/en/library/nod/22/" class="inline-flex font-sans items-center px-4 py-2 text-base font-medium bg-vb-header-top bg-opacity-30 border border-vb-header-top border-opacity-30 rounded-lg hover:bg-opacity-50">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO<svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 448 512" class="ml-2" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M190.5 66.9l22.2-22.2c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0L441 239c9.4 9.4 9.4 24.6 0 33.9L246.6 467.3c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0l-22.2-22.2c-9.5-9.5-9.3-25 .4-34.3L311.4 296H24c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24v-32c0-13.3 10.7-24 24-24h287.4L190.9 101.2c-9.8-9.3-10-24.8-.4-34.3z"></path></svg></a></div></main></div><div id="footer" class="mt-auto pt-3 mb-6 text-sm text-vb-normal-text/80 text-center"><div class="px-4 py-4 w-full max-w-screen-xl mx-auto md:px-8 text-sm text-vb-normal-text/80"><div class="py-2 px-3 border border-dashed border-vb-normal-text/15 text-justify relative "><a href="/en/donate/" class="z-20 float-right my-2 ml-3 w-auto border border-vb-action-border bg-vb-action-bg hover:bg-vb-action-bg/80 rounded-md text-vb-action-text py-3 px-6 text-center disabled:opacity-50">Donate</a><span class="flex-grow">Thanks to <span>Vinod Bapat and Meenal Bapat; Mahavisnupriya dasi &amp; Gostavihari das;   Kuldip Persaud; Gagan Kangovi; Rajendra and Geeta Ramchandani; NIOS - North American Institute for Oriental and Classical Studies; Jaykumar Prabhakar; Anantha SriSimha das, Spore; Bharat Vyas; HG Lakshmipati Narayan Das; HG Ragatmika Gopika Devi Dasi; Shri Chander Mohan Gilhotra; HG Prashant Mukund Das; Shri Trilok Singh Grover; Aneesh Koppula; Ronak Talati; Bhargav Ashok; J.K Ahuja; Akiralali; Radhapati Das; Bimal Gupta; Rajasa das; Aishwarya Balaraj; Yogendra Sharad Puranik; Riya and Tejal Chopade; Devarajula Pradeep Kumar (Saroornagar, Hyderabad); Late Chetana Dilip Bhatt; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/indradyumna-swami">Indradyumna Swami</a>; Sachin; Geetanjali Nath; Mario; Joeie; Susheela and Rama Krishna Reddy Patlolla; Jai Devaki Parks; Ashmi Chakraborty; Hari-kirtana das; Ramesta das; Prasad Buddhavarapu; dasa; Kresna Sucandra; Late Mr. S.

In other words, the extent of His qualities is inconceivable.2e:T48a,Besides these, there are other transcendental qualities, which are described by Lord Śiva to Pārvatī in the \u003cem\u003ePadma Purāṇa,\u003c/em\u003e and in the First Canto of \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e in connection with a conversation between the deity of the earth and the king of religion, Yamarāja. It is said therein, “Persons who are desirous of becoming great personalities must be decorated with the following qualities: truthfulness, cleanliness, mercy, perseverance, renunciation, peacefulness, simplicity, control of the senses, equilibrium of the mind, austerity, equality, forbearance, placidity, learning, knowledge, detachment, opulence, chivalry, influence, strength, memory, independence, tactfulness, luster, patience, kind-heartedness, ingenuity, gentility, mannerliness, determination, perfection in all knowledge, proper execution, possession of all objects of enjoyment, gravity, steadiness, faithfulness, fame, respectfulness and lack of false egotism.” Persons who are desiring to become great souls cannot be without any of the above qualities, so we can know for certain that these qualities are found i"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"n Lord Kṛṣṇa, the supreme soul.2f:T46e,There are certain characteristics of different limbs that are considered to be very auspicious and are fully present in the body of the Lord. In this connection, one friend of Nanda Mahārāja, speaking about Lord Kṛṣṇa’s auspicious bodily symptoms, said, “My dear King of the cowherds, I can find thirty-two auspicious symptoms on the body of your son! I am wondering how this boy could have taken His birth in a family of cowherd men.” Generally, when Lord Kṛṣṇa appears He does so in a family of \u003cem\u003ekṣatriyas\u003c/em\u003e (kings), as did Lord Rāmacandra, and sometimes in a family of \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇas.\u003c/em\u003e But Kṛṣṇa accepted the role of son to Mahārāja Nanda, despite the fact that Nanda belonged to the \u003cem\u003evaiśya\u003c/em\u003e community. The business of the \u003cem\u003evaiśya\u003c/em\u003e community is trade, commerce and the protection of cows. Therefore his friend, who may have been born into a \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa\u003c/em\u003e family, expressed his wonder at how such an exalted child could take birth in a family of \u003cem\u003evaiśyas.\u003c/em\u003e Anyway, he pointed out the auspicious signs on the body of Kṛṣṇa to the boy’s foster father.30:T541,A person whose word of honor is never broken is called truthful. Kṛṣṇa once promised Kuntī, the mother of the Pāṇḍavas, that He would bring her five sons back from the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra. After the battle was finished, when all the Pāṇḍavas had come home, Kuntī praised Kṛṣṇa because His promise was so nicely fulfilled. She said, “Even the sunshine may one day become cool and the moonshine one day become hot, but still Your promise will not fail.” Similarly, when Kṛṣṇa, along with Bhīma and Arjuna, went to challenge Jarāsandha, He plainly told Jarāsandha that He was the eternal Kṛṣṇa, present along with two of the Pāṇḍavas. The story is that both Kṛṣṇa and the Pāṇḍavas – in this case Bhīma and Arjuna – were \u003cem\u003ekṣatriyas\u003c/em\u003e (warrior-kings). Jarāsandha was also a \u003cem\u003ekṣa"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"triya\u003c/em\u003e and was very charitable toward the \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇas.\u003c/em\u003e Thus Kṛṣṇa, who had planned to fight with Jarāsandha, went to him with Bhīma and Arjuna in the dress of \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇas.\u003c/em\u003e Jarāsandha, being very charitable toward the \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇas,\u003c/em\u003e asked them what they wanted and they expressed their desire to fight with him. Then Kṛṣṇa, dressed as a \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa,\u003c/em\u003e declared Himself to be the same Kṛṣṇa who was the king’s eternal enemy.31:T484,Kṛṣṇa’s receiving education from Sāndīpani Muni is described by Śrī Nārada Muni as follows: “In the beginning, Lord Brahmā and others are like clouds of evaporated water from the great ocean of Kṛṣṇa. In other words, Brahmā first received the Vedic education from Kṛṣṇa, as the clouds receive water from the ocean. That Vedic education or instruction which was spoken by Brahmā to the world was then reposed upon the mountain of Sāndīpani Muni. Sāndīpani Muni’s instructions to Kṛṣṇa are like a reservoir of water on the mountain, which flows as a river and goes again to mix with the source, the ocean of Kṛṣṇa.” To be more clear, the idea is that Kṛṣṇa actually cannot be instructed by anyone, just as the ocean does not receive water from any source but itself. It only appears that the rivers are pouring water into the ocean. So it is clear that Brahmā received his education from Kṛṣṇa, and from Brahmā, via the disciplic succession, this Vedic instruction was distributed. Sāndīpani Muni is likened to the river which is flowing down again to that same original ocean of Kṛṣṇa.32:T42c,Regarding His moral principles, it is stated in \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e that Kṛṣṇa is ruling over Vṛndāvana as death personified to the thieves, as pleasing bliss to the pious, as the most beautiful Cupid to the young girls and as the most munificent personality to the poor men. He is as refreshing as the full moon to His friends, and to His opponents He is the annihilating "])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"fire generated from Lord Śiva. Kṛṣṇa is therefore the most perfect moralist in His reciprocal dealings with different kinds of persons. When He is death personified to the thieves, it is not that He is without moral principles or that He is cruel; He is still kind, because to punish thieves with death is to exhibit the highest quality of moral principles. In \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā,\u003c/em\u003e also, Kṛṣṇa says that He deals with different kinds of persons according to their dealings with Him. Kṛṣṇa’s dealings with devotees and with nondevotees, although different, are equally good. Because Kṛṣṇa is all-good, His dealings with everyone are always good.33:T4c7,Any person who can quickly execute a very difficult task is called expert. About the expertise of Kṛṣṇa there is a statement in the Tenth Canto, fifty-ninth chapter, verse 17 of \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,\u003c/em\u003e wherein Śukadeva Gosvāmī tells Mahārāja Parīkṣit, “O best of the Kurus, Śrī Kṛṣṇa cut to pieces all the different weapons used by different fighters.” Formerly, fighting was done by releasing different kinds of arrows. One party would release a certain arrow, and the other party had to defeat it by counteracting it with another arrow. For example, one party might release an arrow that would cause water to pour from the sky, and to counteract this the opposing party would have to release an arrow that could immediately turn the water into clouds. So from this statement it appears that Kṛṣṇa was very expert in counteracting the enemy’s arrows. Similarly, at the \u003cem\u003erāsa\u003c/em\u003e dance, each and every \u003cem\u003egopī\u003c/em\u003e requested that Kṛṣṇa individually become her partner, and Kṛṣṇa immediately expanded Himself into so many Kṛṣṇas in order to be coupled with each and every \u003cem\u003egopī.\u003c/em\u003e The result was that each \u003cem\u003egopī\u003c/em\u003e found Kṛṣṇa by her side.34:T51f,Any person who observes regulative principles and fulfills his promises by practical activity is called determined. As far as the Lor"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"d’s determination is concerned, there is an example in His dealings in the \u003cem\u003eHari-vaṁśa.\u003c/em\u003e This is in connection with Lord Kṛṣṇa’s fighting the king of heaven, Indra, who was forcibly deprived of the \u003cem\u003epārijāta\u003c/em\u003e flower. \u003cem\u003ePārijāta\u003c/em\u003e is a kind of lotus flower grown on the heavenly planets. Once, Satyabhāmā, one of Kṛṣṇa’s queens, wanted that lotus flower, and Kṛṣṇa promised to deliver it; but Indra refused to part with his \u003cem\u003epārijāta\u003c/em\u003e flower. Therefore there was a great fight, with Kṛṣṇa and the Pāṇḍavas on one side and all of the demigods on the other. Ultimately, Kṛṣṇa defeated all of them and took the \u003cem\u003epārijāta\u003c/em\u003e flower, which He presented to His queen. So, in regard to that occurrence, Kṛṣṇa told Nārada Muni, “My dear great sage of the demigods, now you can declare to the devotees in general, and to the nondevotees in particular, that in this matter of taking the \u003cem\u003epārijāta\u003c/em\u003e flower, all the demigods – the Gandharvas, the Nāgas, the demon Rākṣasas, the Yakṣas, the Pannagas – tried to defeat Me, but none could make Me break My promise to My queen.”35:T559,A person who acts exactly according to the tenets of scripture is called \u003cem\u003eśāstra-cakṣus. Śāstra-cakṣus\u003c/em\u003e means one who sees through the eyes of the authorized scriptures. Actually, any man of knowledge and experience should see everything through these books. For example, with our naked eye we perceive the sun globe simply as some glaring substance, but when we see through authorized books of science and other literature, we can understand how much greater the sun globe is than this earth and how powerful it is. So seeing things through the naked eye is not actually seeing. Seeing things through the authorized books or authorized teachers is the correct way to see. So, although Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and can see all that is past, present and future, to teach the people in general He used to always refer to the"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1," scriptures. For example, in \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā,\u003c/em\u003e although Kṛṣṇa was speaking as the supreme authority, He still mentioned and quoted \u003cem\u003eVedānta-sūtra\u003c/em\u003e as authority. There is a statement in \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e wherein a person jokingly says that Kṛṣṇa, the enemy of Kaṁsa, is known as the seer through the \u003cem\u003eśāstras.\u003c/em\u003e In order to establish His authority, however, He is now engaged in seeing the \u003cem\u003egopīs,\u003c/em\u003e whereby the \u003cem\u003egopīs\u003c/em\u003e are becoming maddened.36:T4aa,In this connection, Vidura, while trying to detach his elder brother, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, from his familial attachments, said, “My dear brother, you just fix your mind on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, who is worshiped with beautiful, erudite verses by great sages and saintly persons. Kṛṣṇa is the supreme deliverer among all deliverers. Undoubtedly there are great demigods like Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā, but their positions as deliverers depend always upon the mercy of Kṛṣṇa.” Therefore Vidura advised his elder brother, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, to concentrate his mind and worship only Kṛṣṇa. If one simply chants the holy name of Kṛṣṇa, this holy name will rise within one’s heart like the powerful sun and will immediately dissipate all the darkness of ignorance. Vidura advised Dhṛtarāṣṭra to therefore think always of Kṛṣṇa so that the volumes of contaminations due to sinful activities would be washed off immediately. In \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e also Kṛṣṇa is addressed by Arjuna as \u003cem\u003eparaṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitram\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e –\u003c/em\u003e the supreme pure. There are many other instances exhibiting Kṛṣṇa’s supreme purity.37:T4d1,Śrī Yāmunācārya praises Kṛṣṇa’s power of forgiveness with the following statement: “My dear Lord Rāmacandra, You are so merciful to have excused the crow’s clawing on the nipples of Jānakī simply because of his bowing down before You.” Once Indra, the king of heaven, assumed the form of a crow and attacked S"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"ītā (Jānakī), Lord Rāmacandra’s wife, by striking her on the breast. This was certainly an insult to the universal mother, Sītā, and Lord Rāmacandra was immediately prepared to kill the crow. But because later on the crow bowed down before the Lord, the Lord excused his offense. Śrī Yāmunācārya further says in his prayer that the forgiving power of Lord Kṛṣṇa is even greater than that of Lord Rāmacandra, because Śiśupāla was always in the habit of insulting Kṛṣṇa – not only in one lifetime but continually throughout three lives. Still, Kṛṣṇa was so kind that He gave Śiśupāla the salvation of merging into His existence. From this we can understand that the goal of the monist to merge into the effulgence of the Supreme is not a very difficult problem. Persons like Śiśupāla who are consistently inimical to Kṛṣṇa can also get this liberation.3a:T585,Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, after consulting various scriptures, has enumerated the transcendental qualities of the Lord as follows: (1) beautiful features of the entire body; (2) marked with all auspicious characteristics; (3) extremely pleasing; (4) effulgent; (5) strong; (6) ever youthful; (7) wonderful linguist; (8) truthful; (9) talks pleasingly; (10) fluent; (11) highly learned; (12) highly intelligent; (13) a genius; (14) artistic; (15) extremely clever; (16) expert; (17) grateful; (18) firmly determined; (19) an expert judge of time and circumstances; (20) sees and speaks on the authority of the \u003cem\u003eVedas,\u003c/em\u003e or scriptures; (21) pure; (22) self-controlled; (23) steadfast; (24) forbearing; (25) forgiving; (26) grave; (27) self-satisfied; (28) possessing equilibrium; (29) magnanimous; (30) religious; (31) heroic; (32) compassionate; (33) respectful; (34) gentle; (35) liberal; (36) shy; (37) the protector of surrendered souls; (38) happy; (39) the well-wisher of devotees; (40) controlled by love; (41) all-auspicious; (42) most powerful; (43) all-famous; (44) popular; (45) partial to devotees; (46) very attractive to "])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"all women; (47) all-worshipable; (48) all-opulent; (49) all-honorable; (50) the supreme controller. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has all these fifty transcendental qualities in fullness as deep as the ocean. In other words, the extent of His qualities is inconceivable.3b:T48a,Besides these, there are other transcendental qualities, which are described by Lord Śiva to Pārvatī in the \u003cem\u003ePadma Purāṇa,\u003c/em\u003e and in the First Canto of \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e in connection with a conversation between the deity of the earth and the king of religion, Yamarāja. It is said therein, “Persons who are desirous of becoming great personalities must be decorated with the following qualities: truthfulness, cleanliness, mercy, perseverance, renunciation, peacefulness, simplicity, control of the senses, equilibrium of the mind, austerity, equality, forbearance, placidity, learning, knowledge, detachment, opulence, chivalry, influence, strength, memory, independence, tactfulness, luster, patience, kind-heartedness, ingenuity, gentility, mannerliness, determination, perfection in all knowledge, proper execution, possession of all objects of enjoyment, gravity, steadiness, faithfulness, fame, respectfulness and lack of false egotism.” Persons who are desiring to become great souls cannot be without any of the above qualities, so we can know for certain that these qualities are found in Lord Kṛṣṇa, the supreme soul.3c:T46e,There are certain characteristics of different limbs that are considered to be very auspicious and are fully present in the body of the Lord. In this connection, one friend of Nanda Mahārāja, speaking about Lord Kṛṣṇa’s auspicious bodily symptoms, said, “My dear King of the cowherds, I can find thirty-two auspicious symptoms on the body of your son! I am wondering how this boy could have taken His birth in a family of cowherd men.” Generally, when Lord Kṛṣṇa appears He does so in a family of \u003cem\u003ekṣatriyas\u003c/em\u003e (kings), as did Lord Rāmacandra, and sometimes in a fami"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"ly of \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇas.\u003c/em\u003e But Kṛṣṇa accepted the role of son to Mahārāja Nanda, despite the fact that Nanda belonged to the \u003cem\u003evaiśya\u003c/em\u003e community. The business of the \u003cem\u003evaiśya\u003c/em\u003e community is trade, commerce and the protection of cows. Therefore his friend, who may have been born into a \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa\u003c/em\u003e family, expressed his wonder at how such an exalted child could take birth in a family of \u003cem\u003evaiśyas.\u003c/em\u003e Anyway, he pointed out the auspicious signs on the body of Kṛṣṇa to the boy’s foster father.3d:T541,A person whose word of honor is never broken is called truthful. Kṛṣṇa once promised Kuntī, the mother of the Pāṇḍavas, that He would bring her five sons back from the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra. After the battle was finished, when all the Pāṇḍavas had come home, Kuntī praised Kṛṣṇa because His promise was so nicely fulfilled. She said, “Even the sunshine may one day become cool and the moonshine one day become hot, but still Your promise will not fail.” Similarly, when Kṛṣṇa, along with Bhīma and Arjuna, went to challenge Jarāsandha, He plainly told Jarāsandha that He was the eternal Kṛṣṇa, present along with two of the Pāṇḍavas. The story is that both Kṛṣṇa and the Pāṇḍavas – in this case Bhīma and Arjuna – were \u003cem\u003ekṣatriyas\u003c/em\u003e (warrior-kings). Jarāsandha was also a \u003cem\u003ekṣatriya\u003c/em\u003e and was very charitable toward the \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇas.\u003c/em\u003e Thus Kṛṣṇa, who had planned to fight with Jarāsandha, went to him with Bhīma and Arjuna in the dress of \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇas.\u003c/em\u003e Jarāsandha, being very charitable toward the \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇas,\u003c/em\u003e asked them what they wanted and they expressed their desire to fight with him. Then Kṛṣṇa, dressed as a \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa,\u003c/em\u003e declared Himself to be the same Kṛṣṇa who was the king’s eternal enemy.3e:T484,Kṛṣṇa’s receiving education from Sāndīpani Muni is described by Śrī Nārada Muni as follows: “In the beginning, Lord Brahmā and other"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"s are like clouds of evaporated water from the great ocean of Kṛṣṇa. In other words, Brahmā first received the Vedic education from Kṛṣṇa, as the clouds receive water from the ocean. That Vedic education or instruction which was spoken by Brahmā to the world was then reposed upon the mountain of Sāndīpani Muni. Sāndīpani Muni’s instructions to Kṛṣṇa are like a reservoir of water on the mountain, which flows as a river and goes again to mix with the source, the ocean of Kṛṣṇa.” To be more clear, the idea is that Kṛṣṇa actually cannot be instructed by anyone, just as the ocean does not receive water from any source but itself. It only appears that the rivers are pouring water into the ocean. So it is clear that Brahmā received his education from Kṛṣṇa, and from Brahmā, via the disciplic succession, this Vedic instruction was distributed. Sāndīpani Muni is likened to the river which is flowing down again to that same original ocean of Kṛṣṇa.3f:T42c,Regarding His moral principles, it is stated in \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e that Kṛṣṇa is ruling over Vṛndāvana as death personified to the thieves, as pleasing bliss to the pious, as the most beautiful Cupid to the young girls and as the most munificent personality to the poor men. He is as refreshing as the full moon to His friends, and to His opponents He is the annihilating fire generated from Lord Śiva. Kṛṣṇa is therefore the most perfect moralist in His reciprocal dealings with different kinds of persons. When He is death personified to the thieves, it is not that He is without moral principles or that He is cruel; He is still kind, because to punish thieves with death is to exhibit the highest quality of moral principles.
