user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">There is the following statement in the <em>Haṁsa-dūta:</em> “One day when Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī was feeling much affliction because of Her separation from Kṛṣṇa, She went to the bank of the Yamunā with some of Her friends. There Rādhārāṇī saw a cottage wherein She and Kṛṣṇa had experienced many loving pleasures, and by remembering those incidents She immediately became overcome with dizziness. This dizziness was very prominently visible.” This is an instance of confusion caused by separation.</div></div><div id="bb1207727" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Similarly, there is a statement describing confusion caused by fearfulness. These symptoms were exhibited by Arjuna when he saw Kṛṣṇa’s universal form on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra. His confusion was so strong that his bow and arrows fell from his hand and he could not perceive anything clearly.</div></div><div id="bb1207728" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">DEATH</h2></div><div id="bb1207729" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Once the Bakāsura demon assumed the shape of a very big duck and opened his mouth in order to swallow Kṛṣṇa and all the cowherd boys. When Kṛṣṇa was entering into the demon’s mouth, Balarāma and the other cowherd boys almost fainted and appeared as though they had no life. Even if devotees are illusioned by some ghastly scene or by any accidental occurrence, they never forget Kṛṣṇa. Even in the greatest danger they can remember Kṛṣṇa. This is the benefit of Kṛṣṇa consciousness: even at the time of death, when all the functions of the body become dislocated, the devotee can remember Kṛṣṇa in his innermost consciousness, and this saves him from falling down into material existence. In this way Kṛṣṇa consciousness immediately takes one from the material platform to the spiritual world.</div></div><div id="bb1207730" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In this connection there is a statement about persons who died at Mathurā: “These persons had a slight breathing exhilaration, their eyes were wide open, the colors of their bodies were changed, and they began to utter the holy name of Kṛṣṇa. In this condition they gave up their material bodies.” These symptoms are prior manifestations of death.</div></div><div id="bb1207731" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">LAZINESS</h2></div><div id="bb1207732" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">When, because of self-satisfaction or dislike of excessive labor, a person does not perform his duty in spite of having the energy, he is called lazy. This laziness is also manifested in ecstatic love of Kṛṣṇa. For example, when some <em>brāhmaṇas</em> were requested by Nanda Mahārāja to circumambulate Govardhana Hill, they told him that they were more interested in offering benedictions than in circumambulating Govardhana Hill.

We do not know anyone other than Yourself who would miss this opportunity to associate with young girls in the dead of night!” This is another instance of indirect insults used against Kṛṣṇa in ecstatic love.</div></div><div id="bb1207785" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">ENVY</h2></div><div id="bb1207786" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <em>Padyāvalī,</em> one of the friends of Rādhārāṇī once addressed Her thus: “My dear friend, please do not be too puffed up because Kṛṣṇa has decorated Your forehead with His own hand. It may be that Kṛṣṇa is yet attracted by some other beautiful girl. I see that the decoration on Your forehead is very nicely made, and so it appears that Kṛṣṇa was not too disturbed in painting it. Otherwise, He could not have painted such exact lines!” This is an instance of envy caused by Rādhā’s good fortune.</div></div><div id="bb1207787" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the Tenth Canto, thirtieth chapter, verse 30 of <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</em> there is the following statement: “When the <em>gopīs</em> were searching for Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā after the <em>rāsa</em> dance, they thus began to speak among themselves: ‘We have seen the footprints of Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā on the ground of Vṛndāvana, and they are giving us great pain, because although Kṛṣṇa is everything to us, that girl is so cunning that She has taken Him away alone and is enjoying His kissing without sharing Him with us!’ ” This is another instance of envy of the good fortune of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī.</div></div><div id="bb1207788" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Sometimes when the cowherd boys used to play in the forests of Vṛndāvana, Kṛṣṇa would play on one side, and Balarāma would play on another. There would be competition and mock fighting between the two parties, and when Kṛṣṇa’s party was defeated by Balarāma, the boys would say, “If Balarāma’s party remains victorious, then who in the world can be weaker than ourselves?” This is another instance of envy in ecstatic love.</div></div><div id="bb1207789" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">IMPUDENCE</h2></div><div id="bb1207790" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the Tenth Canto, fifty-second chapter, verse 41 of <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</em> Rukmiṇī addresses a letter to Kṛṣṇa as follows: “My dear unconquerable Kṛṣṇa, my marriage day is fixed for tomorrow. I request that You come to the city of Vidarbha without advertising Yourself. Then have Your soldiers and commanders suddenly surround and defeat all the strength of the King of Magadha, and by thus adopting the methods of the demons, please kidnap and marry me.”</div></div><div id="bb1207791" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">According to the Vedic system there are eight kinds of marriages, one of which is called <em>rākṣasa-vivāha. Rākṣasa-vivāha</em> refers to kidnapping a girl and marrying her by force. This is considered to be a demoniac method. When Rukmiṇī was going to be married to Śiśupāla by the choice of her elder brother, she wrote the above letter to Kṛṣṇa requesting Him to kidnap her. This is an instance of impudence in ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa.</div></div><div id="bb1207792" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">One of the <em>gopīs</em> said, “May Kṛṣṇa’s sweet flute be washed away by the waves of the Yamunā, and let it fall into the ocean!

Sometimes when mother Yaśodā could not hear the sweet vibration of His flute she would become very anxious, and because of this she would feel dizzy. Thus, dizziness caused by anxiety in ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa is also possible.</div></div><div id="bb1207795" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">When Yaśodā had tied Kṛṣṇa up one time, she began to think, “Kṛṣṇa’s body is so soft and delicate.

Sometimes, by thinking of Kṛṣṇa, they became so confident of being out of all danger that they would lie down at night in the courtyards of their houses. This is an instance of dizziness in ecstatic love due to natural affection for Kṛṣṇa.</div></div><div id="bb1207797" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">It may be questioned why devotees of Kṛṣṇa should be attacked by dizziness, which is usually considered a sign of the mode of ignorance. To answer this question, Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī has said that the devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa are always transcendental to all the modes of material nature; when they feel dizziness or go to sleep, they are not considered to be sleeping under the modes of nature, but are accepted as being in a trance of devotional service. There is an authoritative statement in the <em>Garuḍa Purāṇa</em> about mystic <em>yogīs</em> who are under the direct shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead: “In all three stages of their consciousness – namely, wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep – the devotees are absorbed in thought of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, in their complete absorption in thought of Kṛṣṇa, they do not sleep.”</div></div><div id="bb1207798" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">SLEEPINESS</h2></div><div id="bb1207799" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Once Lord Baladeva began to talk in His sleep as follows: “O lotus-eyed Kṛṣṇa, Your childhood adventures are manifest simply according to Your own will. Therefore, please immediately dispose of the stubborn pride of this Kāliya serpent.” By saying this, Lord Baladeva astonished the assembly of the Yadus and made them laugh for some time. Then, yawning so hard as to make ripples on His abdomen, Lord Baladeva, the bearer of the plow, returned to His deep sleep. This is an instance of sleepiness in ecstatic love.</div></div><div id="bb1207800" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">ALERTNESS</h2></div><div id="bb1207801" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">A devotee once stated, “I have already conquered the mode of ignorance, and I am now on the platform of transcendental knowledge. Therefore I shall be engaged only in searching after the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” This is an instance of alertness in ecstatic love. Transcendental alertness is possible when the illusory condition is completely overcome. At that stage, when in contact with any reaction of material elements, such as sound, smell, touch or taste, the devotee realizes the transcendental presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this condition the ecstatic symptoms (e.g., standing of the hair on the body, rolling of the eyeballs and getting up from sleep) are persistently visible.</div></div><div id="bb1207802" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">When Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī first saw Kṛṣṇa, She suddenly became conscious of all transcendental happiness, and the functions of Her different limbs were stunned. When Lalitā, Her constant companion, whispered into Her ear the holy name of Kṛṣṇa, Rādhārāṇī immediately opened Her eyes wide. This is an instance of alertness caused by hearing the sound of Kṛṣṇa’s name.</div></div><div id="bb1207803" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">One day, in a joking mood, Kṛṣṇa informed Rādhārāṇī, “My dear Rādhārāṇī, I am going to give up Your company.” Upon saying this, He immediately disappeared, and because of this Rādhārāṇī became so afflicted that the hue of Her body changed and She immediately fell down upon the ground of Vṛndāvana. She had practically stopped breathing, but when She smelled the flavor of the flowers on the ground, She awoke in ecstasy and got up. This is an instance of transcendental alertness caused by smelling.</div></div><div id="bb1207804" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">When Kṛṣṇa was touching the body of one <em>gopī,</em> the <em>gopī</em> addressed her companion thus: “My dear friend, whose hand is this touching my body?

But after this, when I offered Her some of Your chewed betel nut remnants, She immediately returned to consciousness with jubilant symptoms in Her body.” This is an instance of alertness caused by tasting.</div></div><div id="bb1207806" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">One night Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī was talking in a dream. “My dear Kṛṣṇa,” She said, “please do not play any more jokes on Me! Please stop! And please don’t touch My garments either. Otherwise I shall inform the elderly persons, and I shall disclose all of Your naughty behavior.” While She was talking like this in a dream, She suddenly awoke and saw some of Her superiors standing before Her. Thus Rādhārāṇī became ashamed and bowed Her head. This is an instance of alertness after awakening from sleep.</div></div><div id="bb1207807" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">There is another instance of this. A messenger from Kṛṣṇa came to Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī while She was sleeping, and Rādhārāṇī immediately awakened. Similarly, when Kṛṣṇa began to blow on His flute in the night, all of the <em>gopīs,</em> the beautiful daughters of the cowherd men, immediately got up from their sleep. There is a very beautiful comparison made in this connection: “The lotus flower is sometimes surrounded by white swans, and sometimes it is surrounded by black wasps who are collecting its honey. When there is a thundering in the sky, the swans go away, but the black wasps stay to enjoy the lotus flowers.” The <em>gopīs</em>’ sleeping condition is compared to the white swans, and the sound of Kṛṣṇa’s flute is compared to a black wasp. When Kṛṣṇa’s flute sounded, the white swans, which represent the sleeping condition of the <em>gopīs,</em> were immediately vanquished, and the black wasp sound of the flute began to enjoy the lotus flower of the <em>gopīs</em>’ beauty.</div></div><div class="mt-10 flex justify-between"><a href="/en/library/nod/29/" class="inline-flex font-sans items-center px-4 py-2 mr-4 text-base font-medium bg-vb-header-top bg-opacity-30 border border-vb-header-top border-opacity-30 rounded-lg hover:bg-opacity-50"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 448 512" class="mr-2" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M257.5 445.1l-22.2 22.2c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0L7 273c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9L201.4 44.7c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0l22.2 22.2c9.5 9.5 9.3 25-.4 34.3L136.6 216H424c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24v32c0 13.3-10.7 24-24 24H136.6l120.5 114.8c9.8 9.3 10 24.8.4 34.3z"></path></svg>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</a><a href="/en/library/nod/31/" class="inline-flex font-sans items-center px-4 py-2 text-base font-medium bg-vb-header-top bg-opacity-30 border border-vb-header-top border-opacity-30 rounded-lg hover:bg-opacity-50">CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE<svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 448 512" class="ml-2" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M190.5 66.9l22.2-22.2c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0L441 239c9.4 9.4 9.4 24.6 0 33.9L246.6 467.3c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0l-22.2-22.2c-9.5-9.5-9.3-25 .4-34.3L311.4 296H24c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24v-32c0-13.3 10.7-24 24-24h287.4L190.9 101.2c-9.8-9.3-10-24.8-.4-34.3z"></path></svg></a></div></main></div><div id="footer" class="mt-auto pt-3 mb-6 text-sm text-vb-normal-text/80 text-center"><div class="px-4 py-4 w-full max-w-screen-xl mx-auto md:px-8 text-sm text-vb-normal-text/80"><div class="py-2 px-3 border border-dashed border-vb-normal-text/15 text-justify relative "><a href="/en/donate/" class="z-20 float-right my-2 ml-3 w-auto border border-vb-action-border bg-vb-action-bg hover:bg-vb-action-bg/80 rounded-md text-vb-action-text py-3 px-6 text-center disabled:opacity-50">Donate</a><span class="flex-grow">Thanks to <span>Vinod Bapat and Meenal Bapat; Mahavisnupriya dasi &amp; Gostavihari das;   Kuldip Persaud; Gagan Kangovi; Rajendra and Geeta Ramchandani; NIOS - North American Institute for Oriental and Classical Studies; Jaykumar Prabhakar; Anantha SriSimha das, Spore; Bharat Vyas; HG Lakshmipati Narayan Das; HG Ragatmika Gopika Devi Dasi; Shri Chander Mohan Gilhotra; HG Prashant Mukund Das; Shri Trilok Singh Grover; Aneesh Koppula; Ronak Talati; Bhargav Ashok; J.K Ahuja; Akiralali; Radhapati Das; Bimal Gupta; Rajasa das; Aishwarya Balaraj; Yogendra Sharad Puranik; Riya and Tejal Chopade; Devarajula Pradeep Kumar (Saroornagar, Hyderabad); Late Chetana Dilip Bhatt; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/indradyumna-swami">Indradyumna Swami</a>; Sachin; Geetanjali Nath; Mario; Joeie; Susheela and Rama Krishna Reddy Patlolla; Jai Devaki Parks; Ashmi Chakraborty; Hari-kirtana das; Ramesta das; Prasad Buddhavarapu; dasa; Kresna Sucandra; Late Mr. S.

This is the benefit of Kṛṣṇa consciousness: even at the time of death, when all the functions of the body become dislocated, the devotee can remember Kṛṣṇa in his innermost consciousness, and this saves him from falling down into material existence. In this way Kṛṣṇa consciousness immediately takes one from the material platform to the spiritual world.\"}}]}],[\"$\",\"$L30\",\"child-95377\",{\"child\":\"$2b:props:children:0:props:children:props:page:child_items:0:children:5\",\"hasId\":true,\"children\":[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify\",\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"In this connection there is a statement about persons who died at Mathurā: “These persons had a slight breathing exhilaration, their eyes were wide open, the colors of their bodies were changed, and they began to utter the holy name of Kṛṣṇa.

When Kṛṣṇa’s flute sounded, the white swans, which represent the sleeping condition of the \u003cem\u003egopīs,\u003c/em\u003e were immediately vanquished, and the black wasp sound of the flute began to enjoy the lotus flower of the \u003cem\u003egopīs\u003c/em\u003e’ beauty.\"}}]}]]}]]],[\"$\",\"$L33\",null,{\"pager\":\"$2b:props:children:0:props:children:props:page:pager\",\"activeView\":\"$13:props:activeView\"}]]}]]}],\"$L34\",[\"$\",\"$L25\",null,{\"locale\":\"en\"}]]}]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"35:I[9322,[\"77\",\"static/chunks/5d4ed50a-f7c8be9a807e6ca6.js\",\"825\",\"static/chunks/31d7845b-021f9da3f9697e63.js\",\"971\",\"static/chunks/9520ad3f-48ea89eb93611988.js\",\"570\",\"static/chunks/061bc62c-731c4c5361c0b1a6.js\",\"80\",\"static/chunks/726d83c0-3c02be48ed596e6c.js\",\"462\",\"static/chunks/ccbff8d1-cc06647d0fb1d006.js\",\"244\",\"static/chunks/244-e90cecb8df7c71e4.js\",\"643\",\"static/chunks/643-27761253fa6e620a.js\",\"718\",\"static/chunks/718-a66a69860517a935.js\",\"685\",\"static/chunks/685-ce87992f230bf79b.js\",\"75\",\"static/chunks/75-09b37c6ebdea24fa.js\",\"755\",\"static/chunks/755-4e4c0d39ad776baf.js\",\"851\",\"static/chunks/851-b5ca56f5cce56349.js\",\"926\",\"static/chunks/926-7b54e3f38d066b8f.js\",\"963\",\"static/chunks/app/%5Blocale%5D/%5B...path%5D/page-089706ccb06c84ad.js\"],\"default\"]\n2f:[\"$\",\"div\",\"/en/library/nod/30/\",{\"className\":\"select-none mb-6 text-xs sm:text-base font-sans\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"$L29\",null,{\"className\":\"bg-vb-header-top/80 inline-block border border-vb-header-top border-opacity-20 rounded-md p-2 sm:px-3 mr-1 sm:mr-3 mb-2 whitespace-nowrap text-xs md:text-base text-vb-header-top-text\",\"href\":\"/en/library/nod/30/\",\"children\":\"Default View\"}],false,\"$undefined\",[\"$\",\"$L35\",null,{\"className\":\"bg-vb-header-top/30 hover:bg-vb-header-top/40 inline-block border border-vb-header-top border-opacity-20 rounded-md p-2 sm:px-3 mr-1 sm:mr-3 mb-2 whitespace-nowrap text-xs md:text-base text-vb-header-top-text cursor-pointer\",\"page\":\"$2b:props:children:0:props:children:props:page\",\"activeView\":\"$13:props:activeView\",\"children\":[[\"Dual Language \",[\"$\",\"span\",\"hideSmall0\",{\"className\":\"hidden sm:inline\",\"children\":[\"View\"]}]],false]}]]}]\n36:T41c,Vinod Bapat and Meenal Bapat; Mahavisnupriya dasi \u0026amp; Gostavihari das;   Kuldip Persaud; Gagan Kangovi; Rajendra and Geeta Ramchandani; NIOS - North American Institute for Oriental and Classical Studies; Jaykumar Prabhakar; Anantha SriSimha das, Spore; Bharat Vyas; HG Lakshmipati Narayan Das; HG Ragatmika Gopika Devi Dasi; Shri Chander Mohan Gilhotra; HG Prashant Mukund Das; Shri Trilok Singh"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1," Grover; Aneesh Koppula; Ronak Talati; Bhargav Ashok; J.K Ahuja; Akiralali; Radhapati Das; Bimal Gupta; Rajasa das; Aishwarya Balaraj; Yogendra Sharad Puranik; Riya and Tejal Chopade; Devarajula Pradeep Kumar (Saroornagar, Hyderabad); Late Chetana Dilip Bhatt; \u003ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://in.linkedin.com/in/indradyumna-swami\"\u003eIndradyumna Swami\u003c/a\u003e; Sachin; Geetanjali Nath; Mario; Joeie; Susheela and Rama Krishna Reddy Patlolla; Jai Devaki Parks; Ashmi Chakraborty; Hari-kirtana das; Ramesta das; Prasad Buddhavarapu; dasa; Kresna Sucandra; Late Mr. S.
