In this connection, in the Tenth Canto, seventy-fourth chapter, verse 40 of <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</em> Śukadeva Gosvāmī tells Parīkṣit Mahārāja, “My dear King, if a person, after hearing blasphemous propaganda against the Lord and His devotees, does not go away from that place, he becomes bereft of the effect of all pious activities.”</div></div><div id="bb1206869" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In one of Lord Caitanya’s <em>Śikṣāṣṭaka</em> verses it is stated, “The devotee should be more tolerant than the tree and more submissive than the grass. He should offer all honor to others but may not accept any honor for himself.” In spite of Lord Caitanya’s being so humble and meek as a devotee, when He was informed about injuries inflicted on the body of Śrī Nityānanda, He immediately ran to the spot and wanted to kill the offenders, Jagāi and Mādhāi. This behavior of Lord Caitanya’s is very significant. It shows that a Vaiṣṇava may be very tolerant and meek, foregoing everything for his personal honor, but when it is a question of the honor of Kṛṣṇa or His devotee, he will not tolerate any insult.</div></div><div id="bb1206870" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">There are three ways of dealing with such insults. If someone is heard blaspheming by words, one should be so expert that he can defeat the opposing party by argument. If he is unable to defeat the opposing party, then the next step is that he should not just stand there meekly but should give up his life. The third process is followed if he is unable to execute the above-mentioned two processes, and this is that he must leave the place and go away. If a devotee does not follow any of the above-mentioned three processes, he falls down from his position of devotion.</div></div><div id="bb1206871" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">TILAKA AND TULASĪ BEADS</h2></div><div id="bb1206872" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <em>Padma Purāṇa</em> there is a statement describing how a Vaiṣṇava should decorate his body with <em>tilaka</em> and beads: “Persons who put <em>tulasī</em> beads on the neck, who mark twelve places of their bodies as Viṣṇu temples with Viṣṇu’s symbolic representations [the four items held in the four hands of Lord Viṣṇu – conch, mace, disc and lotus], and who have <em>viṣṇu-tilaka</em> on their foreheads, are to be understood as the devotees of Lord Viṣṇu in this world.

So therefore I am sure that I shall not be attacked by the spell of the material energy.” The purport of this verse is that for any person who simply follows these rules and regulations of decorating the body with the marks of <em>tilaka</em> made from <em>gopī-candana</em> or sandalwood pulp, and who puts on the garlands that were offered to Kṛṣṇa, there is no question of being conquered by the spell of the material energy.

They are not ordinary buildings, because the worship of Kṛṣṇa should be performed in just the way that a king is worshiped in his palace. So in Vṛndāvana there are many hundreds of temples wherein the Deity is worshiped exactly like a king. In the <em>Nāradīya Purāṇa</em> it is stated, “If a person stays in the Lord’s temple even for a few moments, he can surely achieve the transcendental kingdom of God.”</div></div><div id="bb1206897" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The conclusion is that those who are rich men in society should construct beautiful temples and arrange for the worship of Viṣṇu, so that people may be attracted to visit such temples and thereby be offered the opportunity of dancing before the Lord or chanting the holy name of the Lord, or else of hearing the holy name of the Lord. In this way, everyone will be given the chance to elevate himself to the kingdom of God.

No demigod can perform this act of delivering the conditioned souls because the demigods themselves are conditioned. A conditioned soul cannot deliver another conditioned soul. Only Kṛṣṇa or His bona fide representative can deliver him. The Ganges water, which is flowing down from the toe of Lord Viṣṇu, falls upon the earthly planet and other planets and thereby delivers all the conditioned sinful living entities. So what need is there to speak of the deliverance of persons who are always engaged in the service of the Lord? There is no doubt about their liberation, even if they have stocks of sinful activities from many, many births.” In other words, a person who is engaged in the worship of the Deities can minimize his stock of sinful reactions coming from many, many previous births.

This desiring some perfectional stage in spiritual life is not sense gratification. When one realizes something of his constitutional relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he understands his original position and wants to be reinstated in this position, either as friend, servant, parent or conjugal lover of Kṛṣṇa. That is called <em>lālasā-mayī,</em> or very eagerly desiring to go to one’s natural position. This <em>lālasā-mayī</em> stage of submission comes in the stage of perfect liberation, which is technically called <em>svarūpa-siddhi,</em> when the living entity understands, by perfect spiritual advancement and revelation, his original relationship with the Lord.</div></div><div id="bb1206912" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <em>Padma Purāṇa</em> there is a statement of submission in feeling by devotees praying to the Lord: “My Lord, I know that young girls have natural affection for young boys, and that young boys have natural affection for young girls.

When a young boy or girl sees a member of the opposite sex there is a natural attraction, without the need for any introduction. Without any training there is a natural attraction due to the sex impulse. This is a material example, but the devotee is praying that he may develop a similar spontaneous attachment for the Supreme Lord, free from any desire for profit and without any other cause.

As far as the conditioned soul is concerned, there is no wonder that he has some sinful activities in his past life, and this should be admitted and confessed before the Lord. As soon as this is done, the Lord excuses the sincere devotee. But that does not mean that one should take advantage of the Lord’s causeless mercy and expect to be excused over and over again, while he commits the same sinful activities. Such a mentality is only for shameless persons. Here it is clearly said, “When I come to confess my sinful activities I become ashamed.” So if a person is not ashamed of his sinful activities and continues to commit the same sinful activities with the knowledge that the Lord will excuse him, that is a most nonsensical proposition. Such an idea is not accepted in any part of the Vedic literature. It is a fact that by chanting the holy name of the Lord one becomes washed clean of all sinful activities from his past life. But that does not mean that after being washed off, one should again begin sinful activities and expect to be washed again. These are nonsensical propositions and are not admitted in devotional service. Someone may think, “For a whole week I may commit sinful activities, and for one day I will go to the temple or church and admit my sinful activities so that I can become washed off and again begin my sinning.” This is most nonsensical and offensive and is not acceptable to the author of <em>Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu.</em></div></div><div id="bb1206914" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <em>Nārada Pañcarātra</em> there is a statement of submission accompanied by the desire for perfection.

That means that he is desiring to become the personal associate of the Supreme Lord. Of course, any devotee in any capacity, either as servant, friend or conjugal lover, always has direct association with the Lord. But according to his different individual taste, a person desires for just one of these relationships. Here the devotee is desiring to become a servant of the Lord and desires to fan the Lord, as does His internal energy, Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune.

Lord Caitanya also desired that “a moment will appear unto me as twelve years of time, and the whole world will appear to me as vacant on account of not seeing You, my dear Lord.” One should feelingly pray and become eager to render his particular type of service to the Lord.

The pure devotees have nothing to ask from any demigod; rather, the demigods are anxious to offer prayers to the pure devotees.</div></div><div id="bb1206920" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <em>Nṛsiṁha Purāṇa</em> it is stated, “Any person who comes before the Deity of Lord Kṛṣṇa and begins to chant different prayers is immediately relieved from all the reactions of sinful activities and becomes eligible, without any doubt, to enter into the Vaikuṇṭha-loka.”</div></div><div id="bb1206921" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">PARTAKING OF PRASĀDA</h2></div><div id="bb1206922" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">There is this specific statement in the <em>Padma Purāṇa:</em> “A person who honors the <em>prasāda</em> and regularly eats it, not exactly in front of the Deity, along with <em>caraṇāmṛta</em> [the water offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, which is mixed with seeds of the <em>tulasī</em> tree], immediately can achieve the results of the pious activities that are obtained through ten thousand performances of sacrificial rites.”</div></div><div id="bb1206923" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">DRINKING CARAṆĀMṚTA</h2></div><div id="bb1206924" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><em>Caraṇāmṛta</em> is obtained in the morning while the Lord is being washed before dressing. Scented with perfumes and flowers, the water comes gliding down through His lotus feet and is collected and mixed with yogurt. In this way this <em>caraṇāmṛta</em> not only becomes very tastefully flavored, but also has tremendous spiritual value. As described in the <em>Padma Purāṇa,</em> even a person who has never been able to give in charity, who has never been able to perform a great sacrifice, who has never been able to study the <em>Vedas,</em> who has never been able to worship the Lord – or, in other words, even one who has never done any pious activities – will become eligible to enter into the kingdom of God if he simply drinks the <em>caraṇāmṛta</em> that is kept in the temple. In the temple it is the custom that the <em>caraṇāmṛta</em> be kept in a big pot. The devotees who come to visit and offer respects to the Deity take three drops of <em>caraṇāmṛta</em> very submissively and feel themselves happy in transcendental bliss.</div></div><div id="bb1206925" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">SMELLING THE INCENSE OR FLOWERS OFFERED TO THE DEITY</h2></div><div id="bb1206926" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <em>Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya</em> there is a statement about the incense which is offered in the temple: “When the devotees smell the good flavor of the incense which is offered to the Deity, they thus become cured of the poisonous effects of material contamination, as much as one becomes cured of a snakebite by smelling the prescribed medicinal herbs.” The explanation of this verse is that there is an herb found in the jungles that expert persons know how to use to revive the consciousness of one who is bitten by a snake. Simply by smelling that herb one becomes immediately relieved of the poisonous effects of the snakebite. The same example is applicable: When a person comes to visit the temple and smells the incense offered to the Deity, he is cured at that time from all his material contamination.</div></div><div id="bb1206927" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Any devotee coming into the temple should always offer something to the Deity – fruit, flowers, incense, etc. If one cannot offer anything in cash, something else must be offered. In India the system is that all the ladies and gentlemen who come in the morning to visit the temple bring so many things. Even one morsel of rice or one morsel of flour can be offered. It is a regulative principle that one should not go to see a saintly person or the Deity in the temple without any offering. The offering may be very humble, or it may be priceless. Even a flower, a little fruit, a little water – whatever is possible – must be offered. So when a devotee comes to offer something to the Deity in the morning, he is sure to smell the good flavor of the incense, and then at once he will become cleansed of the poisonous effect of material existence.</div></div><div id="bb1206928" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">It is stated in the <em>Tantra-śāstra,</em> “If the smell of the garland that was offered to the Deity in the temple enters into a person’s nostrils, immediately his bondage to sinful activities becomes cleared. And even if one has no sinful activities, still, by smelling such remnants of flowers, one can advance from Māyāvādī [impersonalist] to devotee.” There are several instances of this, a prime one being the advancement of the four Kumāras. They were impersonalist Māyāvādīs, but after smelling the remnants of flowers and incense in the temple, they turned to become devotees. From the above verse it appears that the Māyāvādīs, or impersonalists, are more or less contaminated. They are not pure.</div></div><div id="bb1206929" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">It is confirmed in <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</em> “One who has not washed off all reactions of sinful activities cannot be a pure devotee. A pure devotee has no more doubts about the supremacy of the Personality of Godhead, and thus he engages himself in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and devotional service.” A similar statement is in the <em>Agastya-saṁhitā:</em> Just to purify the impurities of our nostrils, we should try to smell the remnants of flowers offered to Kṛṣṇa in the temple.</div></div><div id="bb1206930" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">TOUCHING THE DEITY</h2></div><div id="bb1206931" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <em>Viṣṇu-dharmottara</em> there is a statement about touching the lotus feet of the Lord. It is said, “Only a person who is initiated as a Vaiṣṇava and is executing devotional service in Kṛṣṇa consciousness has the right to touch the body of the Deity.” In India there was agitation during Gandhi’s political movement because the lowborn classes of men like street-sweepers and <em>caṇḍālas</em> are prohibited, according to the Vedic system, from entering the temple. Due to their unclean habits they are prohibited, but at the same time they are given other facilities so they may be elevated to the highest grade of devotional service by association with pure devotees. A man born in any family is not barred, but he must be cleansed. That cleansing process must be adopted. Gandhi wanted to make them clean simply by stamping them with a fictitious name, <em>hari-jana</em> (“children of God”), and so there was a great tug-of-war between the temple owners and Gandhi’s followers.</div></div><div id="bb1206932" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">But anyway, the present law is the law of all scripture – that if anyone is purified he can enter into the temple. Actually, that is the position. Only one who is properly initiated, who is properly following the rules and regulations, can enter and touch the Deity – not all. And one who touches the body of the Deity, following such regulative principles, is immediately delivered from the contamination of material sins, and all of his desires become fulfilled without delay.</div></div><div id="bb1206933" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">SEEING THE DEITY</h2></div><div id="bb1206934" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <em>Varāha Purāṇa</em> there is a statement praising the seeing of the Deity of Śrī Kṛṣṇa in the temple. A devotee says there, “My dear Vasundharā, any person who goes to Vṛndāvana and sees the Deity of Govinda-deva is free from the courthouse of Yamarāja and is allowed to enter into the highest planetary system, in which reside the demigods.” This means that even an ordinary person who goes to Vṛndāvana out of inquisitiveness and by chance sees the temple, especially that of Govinda-deva, even if he is not elevated to the spiritual kingdom, is still assured promotion to the higher planetary systems. This means that simply by visiting the Deity of Govinda in Vṛndāvana one becomes highly elevated in pious life.</div></div><div id="bb1206935" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">OBSERVING ĀRATI AND CELEBRATIONS OF THE LORD</h2></div><div id="bb1206936" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <em>Skanda Purāṇa</em> there is the following description of the result of seeing <em>ārati</em> (worship) of the Deity: “If someone sees the face of the Lord while <em>ārati</em> is going on, he can be relieved of all sinful reactions coming from many, many thousands and millions of years past.

In all festivals the Lord is seated on a car, and the car moves through different streets of the city so that people may take advantage of visiting the Lord. In the <em>Bhaviṣya Purāṇa</em> it is said, “In such a ceremony, if even a <em>caṇḍāla</em> [dog-eater], simply out of curiosity, sees the Lord on the cart, he becomes counted as one of the associates of Viṣṇu.”</div></div><div id="bb1206938" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the <em>Agni Purāṇa</em> it is stated, “Any person who in gladness sees the worship of the Deity in the temple will obtain the results of <em>kriyā-yoga,</em> which are described in the <em>Pañcarātra</em> scripture.” <em>Kriyā-yoga</em> is a system of practice much like practical devotional service, but it is especially meant for the mystic <em>yogīs.</em> In other words, by this gradual process the mystic <em>yogīs</em> are eventually elevated to the devotional service of the Lord.</div></div><div class="mt-10 flex justify-between"><a href="/en/library/nod/8/" class="inline-flex font-sans items-center px-4 py-2 mr-4 text-base font-medium bg-vb-header-top bg-opacity-30 border border-vb-header-top border-opacity-30 rounded-lg hover:bg-opacity-50"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 448 512" class="mr-2" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M257.5 445.1l-22.2 22.2c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0L7 273c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9L201.4 44.7c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0l22.2 22.2c9.5 9.5 9.3 25-.4 34.3L136.6 216H424c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24v32c0 13.3-10.7 24-24 24H136.6l120.5 114.8c9.8 9.3 10 24.8.4 34.3z"></path></svg>CHAPTER EIGHT</a><a href="/en/library/nod/10/" class="inline-flex font-sans items-center px-4 py-2 text-base font-medium bg-vb-header-top bg-opacity-30 border border-vb-header-top border-opacity-30 rounded-lg hover:bg-opacity-50">CHAPTER TEN<svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 448 512" class="ml-2" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M190.5 66.9l22.2-22.2c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0L441 239c9.4 9.4 9.4 24.6 0 33.9L246.6 467.3c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0l-22.2-22.2c-9.5-9.5-9.3-25 .4-34.3L311.4 296H24c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24v-32c0-13.3 10.7-24 24-24h287.4L190.9 101.2c-9.8-9.3-10-24.8-.4-34.3z"></path></svg></a></div></main></div><div id="footer" class="mt-auto pt-3 mb-6 text-sm text-vb-normal-text/80 text-center"><div class="px-4 py-4 w-full max-w-screen-xl mx-auto md:px-8 text-sm text-vb-normal-text/80"><div class="py-2 px-3 border border-dashed border-vb-normal-text/15 text-justify relative "><a href="/en/donate/" class="z-20 float-right my-2 ml-3 w-auto border border-vb-action-border bg-vb-action-bg hover:bg-vb-action-bg/80 rounded-md text-vb-action-text py-3 px-6 text-center disabled:opacity-50">Donate</a><span class="flex-grow">Thanks to <span>Vinod Bapat and Meenal Bapat; Mahavisnupriya dasi &amp; Gostavihari das;   Kuldip Persaud; Gagan Kangovi; Rajendra and Geeta Ramchandani; NIOS - North American Institute for Oriental and Classical Studies; Jaykumar Prabhakar; Anantha SriSimha das, Spore; Bharat Vyas; HG Lakshmipati Narayan Das; HG Ragatmika Gopika Devi Dasi; Shri Chander Mohan Gilhotra; HG Prashant Mukund Das; Shri Trilok Singh Grover; Aneesh Koppula; Ronak Talati; Bhargav Ashok; J.K Ahuja; Akiralali; Radhapati Das; Bimal Gupta; Rajasa das; Aishwarya Balaraj; Yogendra Sharad Puranik; Riya and Tejal Chopade; Devarajula Pradeep Kumar (Saroornagar, Hyderabad); Late Chetana Dilip Bhatt; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/indradyumna-swami">Indradyumna Swami</a>; Sachin; Geetanjali Nath; Mario; Joeie; Susheela and Rama Krishna Reddy Patlolla; Jai Devaki Parks; Ashmi Chakraborty; Hari-kirtana das; Ramesta das; Prasad Buddhavarapu; dasa; Kresna Sucandra; Late Mr. S.

In this connection, in the Eleventh Canto, sixth chapter, verse 46 of \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,\u003c/em\u003e Uddhava says to Kṛṣṇa, “My dear Kṛṣṇa, I have taken things that You have used and enjoyed, such as garlands of flowers, scented oils, garments and ornaments, and I eat only the remnants of Your foodstuff, because I am Your menial servant. So therefore I am sure that I shall not be attacke"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"d by the spell of the material energy.” The purport of this verse is that for any person who simply follows these rules and regulations of decorating the body with the marks of \u003cem\u003etilaka\u003c/em\u003e made from \u003cem\u003egopī-candana\u003c/em\u003e or sandalwood pulp, and who puts on the garlands that were offered to Kṛṣṇa, there is no question of being conquered by the spell of the material energy. At the time of death, there is no question of such a person’s being called by the constables of Yamarāja. Even if one does not accept all the Vaiṣṇava principles but still takes the remnants of foodstuff offered to Kṛṣṇa, or \u003cem\u003ekṛṣṇa-prasāda,\u003c/em\u003e he will gradually become qualified to rise to the platform of a Vaiṣṇava.2e:T4e6,In this connection, there is a statement in the Fourth Canto, twenty-first chapter, verse 31 of the \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,\u003c/em\u003e wherein King Pṛthu says to his subjects, “My dear citizens, please note that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, is actually the deliverer of all fallen, conditioned souls. No demigod can perform this act of delivering the conditioned souls because the demigods themselves are conditioned. A conditioned soul cannot deliver another conditioned soul. Only Kṛṣṇa or His bona fide representative can deliver him. The Ganges water, which is flowing down from the toe of Lord Viṣṇu, falls upon the earthly planet and other planets and thereby delivers all the conditioned sinful living entities. So what need is there to speak of the deliverance of persons who are always engaged in the service of the Lord? There is no doubt about their liberation, even if they have stocks of sinful activities from many, many births.” In other words, a person who is engaged in the worship of the Deities can minimize his stock of sinful reactions coming from many, many previous births. This process of worshiping the Deity has already been described, and one should try to follow these rules and regulations seriously.2f:T462,In the \u003cem\u003eSkanda Purāṇa\u003c/em\u003e there is a "])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"statement about submission unto the lotus feet of the Lord. It is said there that those who are sober devotees can offer their submission to Kṛṣṇa in the following three ways: (1) \u003cem\u003esamprārthanātmikā,\u003c/em\u003e very feelingly offering prayers; (2) \u003cem\u003edainya-bodhikā,\u003c/em\u003e humbly submitting oneself; (3) \u003cem\u003elālasā-mayī,\u003c/em\u003e desiring some perfectional stage. This desiring some perfectional stage in spiritual life is not sense gratification. When one realizes something of his constitutional relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he understands his original position and wants to be reinstated in this position, either as friend, servant, parent or conjugal lover of Kṛṣṇa. That is called \u003cem\u003elālasā-mayī,\u003c/em\u003e or very eagerly desiring to go to one’s natural position. This \u003cem\u003elālasā-mayī\u003c/em\u003e stage of submission comes in the stage of perfect liberation, which is technically called \u003cem\u003esvarūpa-siddhi,\u003c/em\u003e when the living entity understands, by perfect spiritual advancement and revelation, his original relationship with the Lord.30:T753,In the same \u003cem\u003ePadma Purāṇa\u003c/em\u003e there is a statement about submission in humbleness. It is stated there, “My dear Lord, there is no sinful living entity who is more of a sinner than myself. Nor is there a greater offender than myself. I am so greatly sinful and offensive that when I come to confess my sinful activities before You, I am ashamed.” This is a natural position for a devotee. As far as the conditioned soul is concerned, there is no wonder that he has some sinful activities in his past life, and this should be admitted and confessed before the Lord. As soon as this is done, the Lord excuses the sincere devotee. But that does not mean that one should take advantage of the Lord’s causeless mercy and expect to be excused over and over again, while he commits the same sinful activities. Such a mentality is only for shameless persons. Here it is clearly said, “When I come to confess my sinful activities I become ashamed.” So if "])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"a person is not ashamed of his sinful activities and continues to commit the same sinful activities with the knowledge that the Lord will excuse him, that is a most nonsensical proposition. Such an idea is not accepted in any part of the Vedic literature. It is a fact that by chanting the holy name of the Lord one becomes washed clean of all sinful activities from his past life. But that does not mean that after being washed off, one should again begin sinful activities and expect to be washed again. These are nonsensical propositions and are not admitted in devotional service. Someone may think, “For a whole week I may commit sinful activities, and for one day I will go to the temple or church and admit my sinful activities so that I can become washed off and again begin my sinning.” This is most nonsensical and offensive and is not acceptable to the author of \u003cem\u003eBhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu.\u003c/em\u003e31:T46f,In the \u003cem\u003eNārada Pañcarātra\u003c/em\u003e there is a statement of submission accompanied by the desire for perfection. The devotee says, “My dear Lord, when shall that day come when You will ask me to fan Your body, and according to Your pleasure, You will say, ‘You just fan Me in this way’?” The idea in this verse is that the devotee is desiring to personally fan the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That means that he is desiring to become the personal associate of the Supreme Lord. Of course, any devotee in any capacity, either as servant, friend or conjugal lover, always has direct association with the Lord. But according to his different individual taste, a person desires for just one of these relationships. Here the devotee is desiring to become a servant of the Lord and desires to fan the Lord, as does His internal energy, Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune. He also wishes that the Personality of Godhead will be pleased to give him directions as to how to fan. This submission with transcendental desire, or \u003cem\u003elālasā-mayī vijñapti,\u003c/em\u003e is the highest perfectional stage of spiritual real"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"ization.32:T439,\u003cem\u003eCaraṇāmṛta\u003c/em\u003e is obtained in the morning while the Lord is being washed before dressing.

As described in the \u003cem\u003ePadma Purāṇa,\u003c/em\u003e even a person who has never been able to give in charity, who has never been able to perform a great sacrifice, who has never been able to study the \u003cem\u003eVedas,\u003c/em\u003e who has never been able to worship the Lord – or, in other words, even one who has never done any pious activities – will become eligible to enter into the kingdom of God if he simply drinks the \u003cem\u003ecaraṇāmṛta\u003c/em\u003e that is kept in the temple. In the temple it is the custom that the \u003cem\u003ecaraṇāmṛta\u003c/em\u003e be kept in a big pot. The devotees who come to visit and offer respects to the Deity take three drops of \u003cem\u003ecaraṇāmṛta\u003c/em\u003e very submissively and feel themselves happy in transcendental bliss.35:T4d0,The next instruction is that one should put on flower garlands that are offered to the Deity. In this connection, in the Eleventh Canto, sixth chapter, verse 46 of \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,\u003c/em\u003e Uddhava says to Kṛṣṇa, “My dear Kṛṣṇa, I have taken things that You have used and enjoyed, such as garlands of flowers, scented oils, garments and ornaments, and I eat only the remnants of Your foodstuff, because I am Your menial servant. So therefore I am sure that I shall not be attacked by the spell of the material energy.” The purport of this verse is that for any person who simply follows these rules and regulations of decorating the body with the marks of \u003cem\u003etilaka\u003c/em\u003e made from \u003cem\u003egopī-candana\u003c/em\u003e or sandalwood pulp, and who puts on the garlands that were offered to Kṛṣṇa, there is no question of being conquered by the spell of the material energy.

Even if one does not accept all the Vaiṣṇava principles but still takes the remnants of foodstuff offered to Kṛṣṇa, or \u003cem\u003ekṛṣṇa-prasāda,\u003c/em\u003e he will gradually become qualified to rise to the platform of a Vaiṣṇava.36:T4e6,In this connection, there is a statement in the Fourth Canto, twenty-first chapter, verse 31 of the \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,\u003c/em\u003e wherein King Pṛthu says to his subjects, “My dear citizens, please note that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, is actually the deliverer of all fallen, conditioned souls. No demigod can perform this act of delivering the conditioned souls because the demigods themselves are conditioned. A conditioned soul cannot deliver another conditioned soul. Only Kṛṣṇa or His bona fide representative can deliver him. The Ganges water, which is flowing down from the toe of Lord Viṣṇu, falls upon the earthly planet and other planets and thereby delivers all the conditioned sinful living entities. So what need is there to speak of the deliverance of persons who are always engaged in the service of the Lord? There is no doubt about their liberation, even if they have stocks of sinful activities from many, many births.” In other words, a person who is engaged in the worship of the Deities can minimize his stock of sinful reactions coming from many, many previous births. This process of worshiping the Deity has already been described, and one should try to follow these rules and regulations seriously.37:T462,In the \u003cem\u003eSkanda Purāṇa\u003c/em\u003e there is a statement about submission unto the lotus feet of the Lord. It is said there that those who are sober devotees can offer their submission to Kṛṣṇa in the following three ways: (1) \u003cem\u003esamprārthanātmikā,\u003c/em\u003e very feelingly offering prayers; (2) \u003cem\u003edainya-bodhikā,\u003c/em\u003e humbly submitting oneself; (3) \u003cem\u003elālasā-mayī,\u003c/em\u003e desiring some perfectional stage. This desiring some perfectional stage in spiritual life is not sense gratif"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"ication. When one realizes something of his constitutional relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he understands his original position and wants to be reinstated in this position, either as friend, servant, parent or conjugal lover of Kṛṣṇa. That is called \u003cem\u003elālasā-mayī,\u003c/em\u003e or very eagerly desiring to go to one’s natural position. This \u003cem\u003elālasā-mayī\u003c/em\u003e stage of submission comes in the stage of perfect liberation, which is technically called \u003cem\u003esvarūpa-siddhi,\u003c/em\u003e when the living entity understands, by perfect spiritual advancement and revelation, his original relationship with the Lord.38:T753,In the same \u003cem\u003ePadma Purāṇa\u003c/em\u003e there is a statement about submission in humbleness. It is stated there, “My dear Lord, there is no sinful living entity who is more of a sinner than myself. Nor is there a greater offender than myself. I am so greatly sinful and offensive that when I come to confess my sinful activities before You, I am ashamed.” This is a natural position for a devotee. As far as the conditioned soul is concerned, there is no wonder that he has some sinful activities in his past life, and this should be admitted and confessed before the Lord. As soon as this is done, the Lord excuses the sincere devotee. But that does not mean that one should take advantage of the Lord’s causeless mercy and expect to be excused over and over again, while he commits the same sinful activities. Such a mentality is only for shameless persons. Here it is clearly said, “When I come to confess my sinful activities I become ashamed.” So if a person is not ashamed of his sinful activities and continues to commit the same sinful activities with the knowledge that the Lord will excuse him, that is a most nonsensical proposition. Such an idea is not accepted in any part of the Vedic literature. It is a fact that by chanting the holy name of the Lord one becomes washed clean of all sinful activities from his past life. But that does not mean that after being washed off, one should "])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"again begin sinful activities and expect to be washed again. These are nonsensical propositions and are not admitted in devotional service. Someone may think, “For a whole week I may commit sinful activities, and for one day I will go to the temple or church and admit my sinful activities so that I can become washed off and again begin my sinning.” This is most nonsensical and offensive and is not acceptable to the author of \u003cem\u003eBhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu.\u003c/em\u003e39:T46f,In the \u003cem\u003eNārada Pañcarātra\u003c/em\u003e there is a statement of submission accompanied by the desire for perfection. The devotee says, “My dear Lord, when shall that day come when You will ask me to fan Your body, and according to Your pleasure, You will say, ‘You just fan Me in this way’?” The idea in this verse is that the devotee is desiring to personally fan the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That means that he is desiring to become the personal associate of the Supreme Lord. Of course, any devotee in any capacity, either as servant, friend or conjugal lover, always has direct association with the Lord. But according to his different individual taste, a person desires for just one of these relationships. Here the devotee is desiring to become a servant of the Lord and desires to fan the Lord, as does His internal energy, Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune. He also wishes that the Personality of Godhead will be pleased to give him directions as to how to fan. This submission with transcendental desire, or \u003cem\u003elālasā-mayī vijñapti,\u003c/em\u003e is the highest perfectional stage of spiritual realization.3a:T439,\u003cem\u003eCaraṇāmṛta\u003c/em\u003e is obtained in the morning while the Lord is being washed before dressing.
