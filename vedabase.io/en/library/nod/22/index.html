While dying, Grandfather Bhīṣma prayed to Kṛṣṇa and described Him as the sun that eradicated darkness. The kings imprisoned by Magadhendra were put into dark cells, and when Kṛṣṇa appeared there the darkness immediately disappeared, just as if the sun had risen. In other words, although Magadhendra was able to imprison so many kings, upon the appearance of Kṛṣṇa they were all released. Kṛṣṇa released the kings out of His sincere compassion for them.</div></div><div id="bb1207326" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Kṛṣṇa’s compassion was also exhibited when Grandfather Bhīṣma was lying on the bed of arrows which had been shot through his body. While lying in this position, Bhīṣma was very anxious to see Kṛṣṇa, and thus Kṛṣṇa appeared there. Upon seeing the pitiable condition of Bhīṣma, Kṛṣṇa began speaking with tears in His eyes. Not only was He shedding tears, but He also forgot Himself in His compassion. Therefore, instead of offering obeisances to Kṛṣṇa directly, devotees offer obeisances to His compassionate nature.

Mother Yaśodā brought some rope from the house and tried to tie up the child, but she could not tie a knot due to the shortness of the rope. She tied together many ropes, but when she finished still the rope was too short. After a while she felt very tired and began to perspire. At that time Kṛṣṇa agreed to be bound up by His mother.

But Kṛṣṇa does not change His body. He appears in His own body and is therefore not affected by the modes of material nature. In the First Canto, eleventh chapter, verse 38 of <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> it is stated that the special prerogative of the supreme controller is that He is not at all affected by the modes of nature. The practical example of this is that devotees who are under the protection of the Lord are also not affected by material nature. To overcome the influence of the material nature is very difficult, but the devotees or the saintly persons who are under the protection of the Lord are not affected. So what need is there to speak of the Lord Himself? To be more clear, although the Lord sometimes appears in this material world, He has nothing to do with the modes of material nature, and He acts with full independence in His transcendental position. This is the special quality of the Lord.</div></div><div id="bb1207387" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">52.  ALL-COGNIZANT</h2></div><div id="bb1207388" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Any person who can understand the feelings of all persons and incidents in all places at all times is called all-cognizant.</div></div><div id="bb1207389" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">A nice example of the all-cognizant quality of the Lord is described in <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</em> First Canto, fifteenth chapter, verse 11 in connection with Durvāsā Muni’s visit to the house of the Pāṇḍavas in the forest. Following a calculated plan, Duryodhana sent Durvāsā Muni and his ten thousand disciples to be guests of the Pāṇḍavas in the forest. Duryodhana arranged for Durvāsā and his men to reach the place of the Pāṇḍavas just when the Pāṇḍavas’ lunchtime ended, so that the Pāṇḍavas would be caught without sufficient means to feed such a large number of guests. Knowing Duryodhana’s plan, Kṛṣṇa came to the Pāṇḍavas and asked their wife, Draupadī, if there were any remnants of food that she could offer to Him. Draupadī offered Him a container in which there was only a little fragment of some vegetable preparation, and Kṛṣṇa at once ate it. At that moment all of the sages accompanying Durvāsā were taking bath in the river, and when Kṛṣṇa felt satisfaction from eating Draupadī’s offering, they also felt satisfaction, and their hunger was gone. Because Durvāsā and his men were unable to eat anything more, they went away without coming into the house of the Pāṇḍavas. In this way the Pāṇḍavas were saved from the wrath of Durvāsā. Duryodhana had sent them because he knew that since the Pāṇḍavas would not be able to receive such a large number, Durvāsā would become angry and the Pāṇḍavas would be cursed.

In other words, although chaste women may follow the rules and regulations of Vedic principles to become ever faithful to their husbands, Kṛṣṇa is able to break their stonelike chastity with the chisel of His beauty. Most of the girlfriends of Kṛṣṇa were married, but because Kṛṣṇa was their friend before their marriages, they could not forget His attractive features, which were always fascinating to them, even after their marriages.</div></div><div id="bb1207394" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">54.  SAC-CID-ĀNANDA-VIGRAHA</h2></div><div id="bb1207395" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Kṛṣṇa’s transcendental body is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. <em>Sat</em> means ever-existing for all time and in all places; in other words, all-pervading in time and space. <em>Cit</em> means full of knowledge. Kṛṣṇa has nothing to learn from anyone. He is independently full of all knowledge. <em>Ānanda</em> means the reservoir of all pleasure. The impersonalists are seeking to merge into the Brahman effulgence of eternity and knowledge, but the major portion of the absolute pleasure which is in Kṛṣṇa is avoided by them. One can enjoy the transcendental blissfulness of merging into the Brahman effulgence after being freed from the contamination of material illusion, false identification, attachment, detachment and material absorption. These are the preliminary qualifications of a person who can realize Brahman. It is stated in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> that one has to become full of joyfulness; this is not exactly joyfulness, but a sense of freedom from all anxieties. Freedom from all anxieties may be the first principle of joyfulness, but it is not actual joyfulness. Those who realize the self, or become <em>brahma-bhūta,</em> are only preparing themselves for the platform of joyfulness. That joyfulness can actually be achieved only when one comes into contact with Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so complete that it includes the transcendental pleasure derived from impersonal or Brahman realization. Even the impersonalist will become attracted to the personal form of Kṛṣṇa, known as Śyāmasundara.</div></div><div id="bb1207396" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">It is confirmed by the statement of <em>Brahma-saṁhitā</em> that the Brahman effulgence is the bodily ray of Kṛṣṇa; the Brahman effulgence is simply an exhibition of the energy of Kṛṣṇa.

Kṛṣṇa’s teacher had requested Kṛṣṇa to bring back his dead son, and to do so Kṛṣṇa went to the place of Yamarāja to claim that soul, who had been brought there by Yamarāja and was being kept under his control. Kṛṣṇa immediately ordered Yamarāja, “Be benefited by My order and return that soul unto Me!” The purport of this incident is that even a person who is under the regulative principles of the laws of nature, and who is therefore punishable by Yamarāja under these laws, can be granted complete immunity by the grace of Kṛṣṇa.</div></div><div id="bb1207405" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Kṛṣṇa’s inconceivable potencies have been described by Śukadeva Gosvāmī as follows: “Kṛṣṇa is bewildering my intelligence because, although He is unborn, He has appeared as the son of Nanda Mahārāja.

The word <em>pa-varga</em> indicates the combination of five Sanskrit letters: <em>pa, pha, ba, bha</em> and <em>ma.</em> These letters are the first letters of the words for five different conditions as described below. The first letter, <em>pa,</em> comes from the word <em>parābhava,</em> which means “defeat.” In this material struggle for existence, we are simply meeting defeat. Actually, we have to conquer birth, death, disease and old age, and because there is no possibility of overcoming all these miserable conditions, due to the illusion of <em>māyā</em> we are simply meeting with <em>parābhava,</em> or defeat. The next letter, <em>pha,</em> is taken from the word <em>phena. Phena</em> is the foam which is found on the mouth when one is very tired (as is commonly observed with horses). The letter <em>ba</em> comes from the word <em>bandha,</em> or bondage. <em>Bha</em> is taken from the word <em>bhīti,</em> or fearfulness. <em>Ma</em> is taken from the word <em>mṛti,</em> or death. So the word <em>pavarga</em> signifies our struggle for existence and our meeting with defeat, exhaustion, bondage, fearfulness and, at last, death. <em>Apavarga</em> means that which can nullify all of these material conditions. Kṛṣṇa is said to be the giver of <em>apavarga,</em> the path of liberation.</div></div><div id="bb1207414" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">For the impersonalists and the enemies of Kṛṣṇa, liberation means merging into the Supreme.

How wonderful it is that although the demons, who were always envious of the demigods, have failed to penetrate Your military phalanx, they have penetrated the region of <em>mitra,</em> the sun globe.” The word <em>mitra</em> is used metaphorically. <em>Mitra</em> means “the sun globe,” and <em>mitra</em> also means “friend.” The demons who opposed Kṛṣṇa as enemies wanted to penetrate His military phalanx, but instead of doing this, they died in battle, and the result was that they penetrated the planet of Mitra, or the sun planet. In other words, they entered into the Brahman effulgence. The example of the sun planet is given here because the sun is ever-illuminating, like the spiritual sky, where there are innumerable illuminating Vaikuṇṭha planets. The enemies of Kṛṣṇa were killed, and instead of penetrating Kṛṣṇa’s phalanx, they entered into the friendly atmosphere of the spiritual effulgence.

His wonderfully attractive form was present during His pastimes on this planet, and by His internal potency He exhibited His opulences, which are striking to everyone. His personal beauty was so great that there was no necessity for His wearing ornaments on His body. In fact, instead of the ornaments’ beautifying Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa’s beauty enhanced the ornaments.”</div></div><div id="bb1207430" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Regarding the attractiveness of Kṛṣṇa’s bodily beauty and the sound vibration of His flute, in the Tenth Canto, twenty-ninth chapter, verse 40 of <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</em> the <em>gopīs</em> address Kṛṣṇa as follows: “Although our attitude toward You resembles loving affairs with a paramour, we cannot but wonder at how no woman can maintain her chastity upon hearing the vibration from Your flute. And not only women, but even stronghearted men are subject to falling down from their position at the sound of Your flute. In fact, we have seen that in Vṛndāvana even the cows, the deer, the birds, the trees – everyone – has been enchanted by the sweet vibration of Your flute and the fascinating beauty of Your person.”</div></div><div id="bb1207431" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In Rūpa Gosvāmī’s <em>Lalita-mādhava,</em> it is said, “One day Kṛṣṇa happened to see the shadow of His beautiful form reflected on the jeweled foreground. Upon seeing this bodily reflection, He expressed His feelings: ‘How wonderful it is that I have never seen such a beautiful form! Although it is My own form, still, like Rādhārāṇī, I am trying to embrace this form and enjoy celestial bliss.’ ” This statement shows how Kṛṣṇa and His shadow reflection are one and the same. There is no difference between Kṛṣṇa and His shadow reflection, nor between Kṛṣṇa and His picture. That is the transcendental position of Kṛṣṇa.</div></div><div id="bb1207432" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The above statements describe some of the wonderful reservoirs of pleasure within Kṛṣṇa, as well as the transcendental qualities of His personality. The transcendental qualities of Kṛṣṇa are compared to the ocean: no one can estimate the length and breadth of the ocean. But as one can understand the ocean’s contents simply by testing one drop of it, so these statements will give us some understanding of Kṛṣṇa’s transcendental position and qualities.</div></div><div id="bb1207433" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the Tenth Canto, fourteenth chapter, verse 7 of <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</em> Lord Brahmā says, “My dear Lord, the inconceivable qualities, beauties and activities which You have revealed by Your presence on this planet cannot be calculated by any material measurement. If one even tries to imagine, ‘Kṛṣṇa may be like this,’ that is also impossible. The day may come when the material scientist, after many, many births or after many, many years, will be able to estimate the atomic constitution of the whole world, or he may be able to count the atomic fragments that permeate the sky, or he may even give an estimate of all the atoms within the universe, but still he will never be able to count the transcendental qualities in Your reservoir of transcendental bliss.”</div></div><div class="mt-10 flex justify-between"><a href="/en/library/nod/21/" class="inline-flex font-sans items-center px-4 py-2 mr-4 text-base font-medium bg-vb-header-top bg-opacity-30 border border-vb-header-top border-opacity-30 rounded-lg hover:bg-opacity-50"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 448 512" class="mr-2" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M257.5 445.1l-22.2 22.2c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0L7 273c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9L201.4 44.7c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0l22.2 22.2c9.5 9.5 9.3 25-.4 34.3L136.6 216H424c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24v32c0 13.3-10.7 24-24 24H136.6l120.5 114.8c9.8 9.3 10 24.8.4 34.3z"></path></svg>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</a><a href="/en/library/nod/23/" class="inline-flex font-sans items-center px-4 py-2 text-base font-medium bg-vb-header-top bg-opacity-30 border border-vb-header-top border-opacity-30 rounded-lg hover:bg-opacity-50">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE<svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 448 512" class="ml-2" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M190.5 66.9l22.2-22.2c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0L441 239c9.4 9.4 9.4 24.6 0 33.9L246.6 467.3c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0l-22.2-22.2c-9.5-9.5-9.3-25 .4-34.3L311.4 296H24c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24v-32c0-13.3 10.7-24 24-24h287.4L190.9 101.2c-9.8-9.3-10-24.8-.4-34.3z"></path></svg></a></div></main></div><div id="footer" class="mt-auto pt-3 mb-6 text-sm text-vb-normal-text/80 text-center"><div class="px-4 py-4 w-full max-w-screen-xl mx-auto md:px-8 text-sm text-vb-normal-text/80"><div class="py-2 px-3 border border-dashed border-vb-normal-text/15 text-justify relative "><a href="/en/donate/" class="z-20 float-right my-2 ml-3 w-auto border border-vb-action-border bg-vb-action-bg hover:bg-vb-action-bg/80 rounded-md text-vb-action-text py-3 px-6 text-center disabled:opacity-50">Donate</a><span class="flex-grow">Thanks to <span>Vinod Bapat and Meenal Bapat; Mahavisnupriya dasi &amp; Gostavihari das;   Kuldip Persaud; Gagan Kangovi; Rajendra and Geeta Ramchandani; NIOS - North American Institute for Oriental and Classical Studies; Jaykumar Prabhakar; Anantha SriSimha das, Spore; Bharat Vyas; HG Lakshmipati Narayan Das; HG Ragatmika Gopika Devi Dasi; Shri Chander Mohan Gilhotra; HG Prashant Mukund Das; Shri Trilok Singh Grover; Aneesh Koppula; Ronak Talati; Bhargav Ashok; J.K Ahuja; Akiralali; Radhapati Das; Bimal Gupta; Rajasa das; Aishwarya Balaraj; Yogendra Sharad Puranik; Riya and Tejal Chopade; Devarajula Pradeep Kumar (Saroornagar, Hyderabad); Late Chetana Dilip Bhatt; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/indradyumna-swami">Indradyumna Swami</a>; Sachin; Geetanjali Nath; Mario; Joeie; Susheela and Rama Krishna Reddy Patlolla; Jai Devaki Parks; Ashmi Chakraborty; Hari-kirtana das; Ramesta das; Prasad Buddhavarapu; dasa; Kresna Sucandra; Late Mr. S.

Ordinary living entities have their constitutional spiritual positions covered. They appear in different bodies, and under the different bodily concepts of life they act. But Kṛṣṇa does not change His body. He appears in His own body and is therefore not affected by the modes of material nature. In the First Canto, eleventh chapter, verse 38 of \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e it is sta"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"ted that the special prerogative of the supreme controller is that He is not at all affected by the modes of nature. The practical example of this is that devotees who are under the protection of the Lord are also not affected by material nature. To overcome the influence of the material nature is very difficult, but the devotees or the saintly persons who are under the protection of the Lord are not affected. So what need is there to speak of the Lord Himself? To be more clear, although the Lord sometimes appears in this material world, He has nothing to do with the modes of material nature, and He acts with full independence in His transcendental position. This is the special quality of the Lord.2e:T652,A nice example of the all-cognizant quality of the Lord is described in \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,\u003c/em\u003e First Canto, fifteenth chapter, verse 11 in connection with Durvāsā Muni’s visit to the house of the Pāṇḍavas in the forest. Following a calculated plan, Duryodhana sent Durvāsā Muni and his ten thousand disciples to be guests of the Pāṇḍavas in the forest. Duryodhana arranged for Durvāsā and his men to reach the place of the Pāṇḍavas just when the Pāṇḍavas’ lunchtime ended, so that the Pāṇḍavas would be caught without sufficient means to feed such a large number of guests. Knowing Duryodhana’s plan, Kṛṣṇa came to the Pāṇḍavas and asked their wife, Draupadī, if there were any remnants of food that she could offer to Him. Draupadī offered Him a container in which there was only a little fragment of some vegetable preparation, and Kṛṣṇa at once ate it. At that moment all of the sages accompanying Durvāsā were taking bath in the river, and when Kṛṣṇa felt satisfaction from eating Draupadī’s offering, they also felt satisfaction, and their hunger was gone. Because Durvāsā and his men were unable to eat anything more, they went away without coming into the house of the Pāṇḍavas. In this way the Pāṇḍavas were saved from the wrath of Durvā"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"sā. Duryodhana had sent them because he knew that since the Pāṇḍavas would not be able to receive such a large number, Durvāsā would become angry and the Pāṇḍavas would be cursed. But Kṛṣṇa saved them from this calamity by His trick and by His all-cognizant quality.2f:T623,Kṛṣṇa’s transcendental body is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. \u003cem\u003eSat\u003c/em\u003e means ever-existing for all time and in all places; in other words, all-pervading in time and space. \u003cem\u003eCit\u003c/em\u003e means full of knowledge. Kṛṣṇa has nothing to learn from anyone. He is independently full of all knowledge. \u003cem\u003eĀnanda\u003c/em\u003e means the reservoir of all pleasure. The impersonalists are seeking to merge into the Brahman effulgence of eternity and knowledge, but the major portion of the absolute pleasure which is in Kṛṣṇa is avoided by them. One can enjoy the transcendental blissfulness of merging into the Brahman effulgence after being freed from the contamination of material illusion, false identification, attachment, detachment and material absorption. These are the preliminary qualifications of a person who can realize Brahman. It is stated in \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e that one has to become full of joyfulness; this is not exactly joyfulness, but a sense of freedom from all anxieties. Freedom from all anxieties may be the first principle of joyfulness, but it is not actual joyfulness. Those who realize the self, or become \u003cem\u003ebrahma-bhūta,\u003c/em\u003e are only preparing themselves for the platform of joyfulness. That joyfulness can actually be achieved only when one comes into contact with Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so complete that it includes the transcendental pleasure derived from impersonal or Brahman realization. Even the impersonalist will become attracted to the personal form of Kṛṣṇa, known as Śyāmasundara.30:T46a,Jayadeva Gosvāmī, in his \u003cem\u003eGīta-govinda,\u003c/em\u003e has sung as follows: “The Lord has saved the \u003cem\u003eVedas\u003c/em\u003e in His form as a fish, and He has borne the whole universe on H"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"is back in the form of a tortoise. He has picked up this earthly planet from the water in the form of a boar. He has killed Hiraṇyakaśipu in the form of Nṛsiṁha. He has cheated Mahārāja Bali in the form of Vāmana. He has annihilated all the dynasties of the \u003cem\u003ekṣatriyas\u003c/em\u003e in the form of Paraśurāma. He has killed all the demons in the form of Lord Rāma. He has accepted the great plow in the form of Balarāma. He has annihilated all the atheistic persons in the form of Kalki. And He has saved all the poor animals in the form of Lord Buddha.”* These are some of the descriptions of the incarnations emanating from Kṛṣṇa, and from \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e it is understood that innumerable incarnations are always coming out from the body of Kṛṣṇa, just like waves in the ocean. No one can even count how many waves there are, and similarly no one can count how many incarnations are coming from the Lord’s body.31:T5c8,Another name for salvation is \u003cem\u003eapavarga. Apavarga\u003c/em\u003e is the opposite of \u003cem\u003epavarga,\u003c/em\u003e or the various miserable conditions of material existence. The word \u003cem\u003epa-varga\u003c/em\u003e indicates the combination of five Sanskrit letters: \u003cem\u003epa, pha, ba, bha\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003ema.\u003c/em\u003e These letters are the first letters of the words for five different conditions as described below. The first letter, \u003cem\u003epa,\u003c/em\u003e comes from the word \u003cem\u003eparābhava,\u003c/em\u003e which means “defeat.” In this material struggle for existence, we are simply meeting defeat.

So the word \u003cem\u003epavarga\u003c/em\u003e signifies our struggle for existence and our meeting with defeat, exhaustion, bondage, fearfulness and, at last, death. \u003cem\u003eApavarga\u003c/em\u003e means that which can nullify all of these material conditions.

The demons and the impersonalists do not care for Kṛṣṇa, but Kṛṣṇa is so kind that He gives this liberation even to His enemies and to the impersonalists. There is the following statement in this connection: “O Murāri [Kṛṣṇa]! How wonderful it is that although the demons, who were always envious of the demigods, have failed to penetrate Your military phalanx, they have penetrated the region of \u003cem\u003emitra,\u003c/em\u003e the sun globe.” The word \u003cem\u003emitra\u003c/em\u003e is used metaphorically. \u003cem\u003eMitra\u003c/em\u003e means “the sun globe,” and \u003cem\u003emitra\u003c/em\u003e also means “friend.” The demons who opposed Kṛṣṇa as enemies wanted to penetrate His military phalanx, but instead of doing this, they died in battle, and the result was that they penetrated the planet of Mitra, or the sun planet. In other words, they entered into the Brahman effulgence. The example of the sun planet is given here because the sun is ever-illuminating, like the spiritual sky, where there are innumerable illuminating Vaikuṇṭha planets. The enemies of Kṛṣṇa were killed, and instead of penetrating Kṛṣṇa’s phalanx, they entered into the friendly atmosphere of the spiritual effulgence. That is the mercy of Kṛṣṇa, and therefore He is known as the deliverer of His enemies also.35:T4b5,Kṛṣṇa does not change His constitutional position, not even when He appears in this material world. Ordinary living entities have their constitutional spiritual positions covered. They appear in different bodies, and under the different bodily "])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"concepts of life they act. But Kṛṣṇa does not change His body. He appears in His own body and is therefore not affected by the modes of material nature. In the First Canto, eleventh chapter, verse 38 of \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e it is stated that the special prerogative of the supreme controller is that He is not at all affected by the modes of nature. The practical example of this is that devotees who are under the protection of the Lord are also not affected by material nature. To overcome the influence of the material nature is very difficult, but the devotees or the saintly persons who are under the protection of the Lord are not affected. So what need is there to speak of the Lord Himself? To be more clear, although the Lord sometimes appears in this material world, He has nothing to do with the modes of material nature, and He acts with full independence in His transcendental position. This is the special quality of the Lord.36:T652,A nice example of the all-cognizant quality of the Lord is described in \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,\u003c/em\u003e First Canto, fifteenth chapter, verse 11 in connection with Durvāsā Muni’s visit to the house of the Pāṇḍavas in the forest. Following a calculated plan, Duryodhana sent Durvāsā Muni and his ten thousand disciples to be guests of the Pāṇḍavas in the forest. Duryodhana arranged for Durvāsā and his men to reach the place of the Pāṇḍavas just when the Pāṇḍavas’ lunchtime ended, so that the Pāṇḍavas would be caught without sufficient means to feed such a large number of guests. Knowing Duryodhana’s plan, Kṛṣṇa came to the Pāṇḍavas and asked their wife, Draupadī, if there were any remnants of food that she could offer to Him. Draupadī offered Him a container in which there was only a little fragment of some vegetable preparation, and Kṛṣṇa at once ate it. At that moment all of the sages accompanying Durvāsā were taking bath in the river, and when Kṛṣṇa felt satisfaction from eating Draupadī’s offering, they"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1," also felt satisfaction, and their hunger was gone. Because Durvāsā and his men were unable to eat anything more, they went away without coming into the house of the Pāṇḍavas. In this way the Pāṇḍavas were saved from the wrath of Durvāsā. Duryodhana had sent them because he knew that since the Pāṇḍavas would not be able to receive such a large number, Durvāsā would become angry and the Pāṇḍavas would be cursed. But Kṛṣṇa saved them from this calamity by His trick and by His all-cognizant quality.37:T623,Kṛṣṇa’s transcendental body is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. \u003cem\u003eSat\u003c/em\u003e means ever-existing for all time and in all places; in other words, all-pervading in time and space. \u003cem\u003eCit\u003c/em\u003e means full of knowledge. Kṛṣṇa has nothing to learn from anyone. He is independently full of all knowledge. \u003cem\u003eĀnanda\u003c/em\u003e means the reservoir of all pleasure. The impersonalists are seeking to merge into the Brahman effulgence of eternity and knowledge, but the major portion of the absolute pleasure which is in Kṛṣṇa is avoided by them. One can enjoy the transcendental blissfulness of merging into the Brahman effulgence after being freed from the contamination of material illusion, false identification, attachment, detachment and material absorption. These are the preliminary qualifications of a person who can realize Brahman. It is stated in \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e that one has to become full of joyfulness; this is not exactly joyfulness, but a sense of freedom from all anxieties. Freedom from all anxieties may be the first principle of joyfulness, but it is not actual joyfulness. Those who realize the self, or become \u003cem\u003ebrahma-bhūta,\u003c/em\u003e are only preparing themselves for the platform of joyfulness. That joyfulness can actually be achieved only when one comes into contact with Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so complete that it includes the transcendental pleasure derived from impersonal or Brahman realization. Even the impersonalist will become attract"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"ed to the personal form of Kṛṣṇa, known as Śyāmasundara.38:T46a,Jayadeva Gosvāmī, in his \u003cem\u003eGīta-govinda,\u003c/em\u003e has sung as follows: “The Lord has saved the \u003cem\u003eVedas\u003c/em\u003e in His form as a fish, and He has borne the whole universe on His back in the form of a tortoise. He has picked up this earthly planet from the water in the form of a boar. He has killed Hiraṇyakaśipu in the form of Nṛsiṁha. He has cheated Mahārāja Bali in the form of Vāmana. He has annihilated all the dynasties of the \u003cem\u003ekṣatriyas\u003c/em\u003e in the form of Paraśurāma. He has killed all the demons in the form of Lord Rāma. He has accepted the great plow in the form of Balarāma. He has annihilated all the atheistic persons in the form of Kalki. And He has saved all the poor animals in the form of Lord Buddha.”* These are some of the descriptions of the incarnations emanating from Kṛṣṇa, and from \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e it is understood that innumerable incarnations are always coming out from the body of Kṛṣṇa, just like waves in the ocean. No one can even count how many waves there are, and similarly no one can count how many incarnations are coming from the Lord’s body.39:T5c8,Another name for salvation is \u003cem\u003eapavarga. Apavarga\u003c/em\u003e is the opposite of \u003cem\u003epavarga,\u003c/em\u003e or the various miserable conditions of material existence. The word \u003cem\u003epa-varga\u003c/em\u003e indicates the combination of five Sanskrit letters: \u003cem\u003epa, pha, ba, bha\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003ema.\u003c/em\u003e These letters are the first letters of the words for five different conditions as described below. The first letter, \u003cem\u003epa,\u003c/em\u003e comes from the word \u003cem\u003eparābhava,\u003c/em\u003e which means “defeat.” In this material struggle for existence, we are simply meeting defeat. Actually, we have to conquer birth, death, disease and old age, and because there is no possibility of overcoming all these miserable conditions, due to the illusion of \u003cem\u003emāyā\u003c/em\u003e we are simply meeting with \u003cem\u003eparābhava,\u003c/em\u003e or defeat.
