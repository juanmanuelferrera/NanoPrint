to see the activities of the Lord at Dvārakā and he saw that Kṛṣṇa was present within every palace in the same body and was engaged in different activities, he was struck with wonder. This is one of the examples of astonishment in devotional service by direct perception. One of the friends of mother Yaśodā said, “Yaśodā, just see the fun! On the one hand, there is your child, who is always captivated by sucking the milk from your breast, and on the other hand there is the great Govardhana Hill, which can obstruct the passing of the clouds. But still, just see how wonderful it is that this great Govardhana Hill is resting on the finger of your child’s left hand just as though it were a toy. Is this not very mysterious?” This statement is another example of astonishment in devotional service by direct perception.</div></div><div id="bb1208215" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">An instance of astonishment in devotional service by indirect perception occurred when Mahārāja Parīkṣit heard from Śukadeva Gosvāmī about Kṛṣṇa’s killing Narakāsura, who had been fighting Kṛṣṇa with eleven <em>akṣauhiṇī</em> divisions of soldiers. Each division of <em>akṣauhiṇī</em> soldiers contained several thousand elephants, several thousand horses and chariots and several hundreds of thousands of infantry soldiers. Narakāsura possessed eleven such divisions, and all of them were throwing arrows toward Kṛṣṇa, but Kṛṣṇa killed them all simply by throwing three arrows from His side. When Mahārāja Parīkṣit heard of this wonderful victory, he immediately rubbed the tears from his eyes and became overwhelmed with joy. This instance is an example of astonishment in devotional service by indirect perception through aural reception.</div></div><div id="bb1208216" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">There is another example of indirect astonishment. Trying to test Kṛṣṇa to see if He were truly the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Brahmā stole all the cowherd boys and cows from Him. But after a few seconds, he saw that Kṛṣṇa was still present with all the cows, calves and cowherd boys exactly in the same way as before. When Lord Brahmā described this incident to his associates on the Satyaloka planet, they all became astonished. Brahmā told them that after taking away all the boys, he saw Kṛṣṇa again playing with the same boys in the same fashion. Their bodily complexion was blackish, almost like Kṛṣṇa’s, and they all had four arms. The same calves and cows were still present there in the same original fashion. Even while describing this incident, Brahmā became almost overwhelmed. “And the most astonishing thing,” he added, “was that many other Brahmās from many different universes had also come there to worship Kṛṣṇa and His associates.”</div></div><div id="bb1208217" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Similarly, when there was a forest fire in the Bhāṇḍīra-vana, Kṛṣṇa instructed His friends to close their eyes tightly, and they all did this. Then when Kṛṣṇa had extinguished the fire, the cowherd boys opened their eyes and saw that they had been relieved from the danger and that their cows and calves were all safe. They began to perceive the wonder of the situation simply by guessing how Kṛṣṇa had saved them.

But even very wonderful activities performed by a person who is not one’s friend will not create any impression.

These chivalrous activities can be manifested in the acts of mock fighting, giving charity, showing mercy and executing religious principles. By performing chivalrous activities in fighting, one is called <em>yuddha-vīra.</em> By charitable activities one is called <em>dāna-vīra.</em> By showing extraordinary mercy one is called <em>dayā-vīra.</em> And when one is munificent in executing religious rites, he is called <em>dharma-vīra.</em> In all such different chivalrous activities, Kṛṣṇa is the object.</div></div><div id="bb1208221" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">When a friend wants to satisfy Kṛṣṇa by performing some chivalrous activities, the friend becomes the challenger and Kṛṣṇa Himself becomes the opponent; or else Kṛṣṇa may give audience to the fighting and by His desire another friend becomes the opponent. A friend once challenged Kṛṣṇa thus: “My dear Mādhava, You are very restless because You think that no one can defeat You. But if You do not flee from here, then I shall show You how I can defeat You. And my friends will be very satisfied to see this!”</div></div><div id="bb1208222" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Kṛṣṇa and Śrīdāmā were very intimate friends, yet Śrīdāmā, out of anger with Kṛṣṇa, challenged Him. When both of them began to fight, all the friends on the bank of the Yamunā enjoyed the wonderful fighting of the two friends. They prepared some arrows for mock fighting, and Kṛṣṇa began to throw His arrows at Śrīdāmā. Śrīdāmā began to block these arrows by whirling his pole, and by Śrīdāmā’s chivalrous activities, Kṛṣṇa became very satisfied. Such mock fighting generally takes place among chivalrous persons and creates wonderful excitement for all viewers.</div></div><div id="bb1208223" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">There is a statement in the <em>Hari-vaṁśa</em> that sometimes Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa fought in the presence of Kuntī, and Arjuna would be defeated by Kṛṣṇa.</div></div><div id="bb1208224" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In such chivalrous fighting between friends, there is sometimes bragging, complacence, pride, power, taking to weapons, challenging and standing as an opponent.

When Stoka-kṛṣṇa, one of the many friends of Kṛṣṇa, was fighting with Him, his father chastised him for fighting with Kṛṣṇa, who was the life and soul of all residents of Vṛndāvana. Upon hearing these chastisements, Stoka-kṛṣṇa stopped his fighting. But Kṛṣṇa continued to challenge him, and thus, in order to meet the challenge, Stoka-kṛṣṇa took his pole and began to display his dexterity by whirling it.</div></div><div id="bb1208229" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Once Śrīdāmā challenged Bhadrasena and said to him, “My dear friend, you needn’t be afraid of me yet.

A person who can sacrifice everything for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa is called munificent. When a person desires to make a sacrifice because of seeing Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa is called the impetus of the munificent activity. When Kṛṣṇa appeared as the son of Nanda Mahārāja, in clear consciousness Nanda Mahārāja desired all auspiciousness for his son and thus began to give valuable cows in charity to all the <em>brāhmaṇas.</em> The <em>brāhmaṇas</em> were so satisfied by this charitable action that they were obliged to say that the charity of Nanda Mahārāja had excelled the charity of such past kings as Mahārāja Pṛthu and Nṛga.</div></div><div id="bb1208234" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">When a person knows the glories of the Lord completely and is prepared to sacrifice everything for the Lord, he is called <em>sampradānaka,</em> or one who gives everything in charity for the sake of Kṛṣṇa.</div></div><div id="bb1208235" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">When Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira went with Kṛṣṇa in the arena of the Rājasūya sacrifice, in his imagination he began to anoint the body of Kṛṣṇa with pulp of sandalwood, he decorated Kṛṣṇa with a garland hanging down to His knees, he gave Kṛṣṇa garments all embroidered with gold, he gave Kṛṣṇa ornaments all bedecked with valuable jewels, and he gave Kṛṣṇa many fully decorated elephants, chariots and horses. He further wished to give Kṛṣṇa in charity his kingdom, his family and his personal self also. After so desiring, when there was nothing actually to give in charity, Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira became very perturbed and anxious.</div></div><div id="bb1208236" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Similarly, Mahārāja Bali once told his priest, Śukrācārya, “My dear sage, you are fully expert in knowledge of the <em>Vedas,</em> and as such you worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, by Vedic rituals. As far as this <em>brāhmaṇa</em> dwarf [the incarnation Vāmana-deva] is concerned, if He is Lord Viṣṇu, a simple <em>brāhmaṇa</em> or even my enemy, I have decided to give to Him in charity all the land He has asked for.” Mahārāja Bali was so fortunate that the Lord extended before him His hand, which was reddish from touching the breast of the goddess of fortune, who is always smeared with red <em>kuṅkuma</em> powder. In other words, although the Personality of Godhead is so great that the goddess of fortune is always under His command for enjoyment, He still extended His hands to take charity from Mahārāja Bali.</div></div><div id="bb1208237" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">A person who wants to give everything in charity to Kṛṣṇa but does not want anything in return is considered the real renouncer.

He says there, “My dear Lord, I have practiced austerities and penances because I was desiring to receive something from You, but in exchange You have allowed me to see You, who are never visible even to the great sages and saintly persons. I had been searching out some pieces of broken glass, but instead I have found the most valuable jewel. I am therefore fully satisfied, my Lord.

The four sages headed by Sanaka Muni addressed the Lord as follows: “Dear Supreme Personality of Godhead, Your reputation is very attractive and free from all material contamination. Therefore You are worthy of being glorified and are actually the reservoir of all places of pilgrimage. Auspicious persons who are fortunate enough to be engaged in glorifying Your attributes and who actually know what Your transcendental position is do not even care to accept liberation offered by You. Because they are so transcendentally enriched, they do not care to accept even the post of Indra, the heavenly king. They know that the post of the king of heaven is also fearful, whereas for those who are engaged in glorifying Your transcendental qualities there is only joyfulness and freedom from all danger. As such, why should persons with this knowledge be attracted by a post in the heavenly kingdom?”</div></div><div id="bb1208240" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">One devotee has described his feelings about the charity exhibited by King Mayūradhvaja: “I am faltering even to speak about the activities of Mahārāja Mayūradhvaja, to whom I offer my respectful obeisances.” Mayūradhvaja was very intelligent, and he could understand why Kṛṣṇa came to him once, in the garb of a <em>brāhmaṇa.</em> Kṛṣṇa demanded from him half of his body, to be sawed off by his wife and son, and King Mayūradhvaja agreed to this proposal. On account of his intense feeling of devotional service, King Mayūradhvaja was always thinking of Kṛṣṇa, and when he understood that Kṛṣṇa had come in the garb of a <em>brāhmaṇa,</em> he did not hesitate to part with half of his body. This sacrifice of Mahārāja Mayūradhvaja for Kṛṣṇa’s sake is unique in the world, and we should offer our all-respectful obeisances to him. He had full knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the garb of a <em>brāhmaṇa,</em> and he is known as the perfect <em>dāna-vīra,</em> or renouncer.</div></div><div id="bb1208241" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Any person who is always ready to satisfy Kṛṣṇa and who is always dexterous in executing devotional service is called <em>dharma-vīra,</em> or chivalrous in executing religious rituals. Only advanced devotees performing religious ritualistic performances can come to this stage of <em>dharma-vīra. Dharma-vīras</em> are produced after going through the authoritative scriptures, following moral principles, being faithful and tolerant and controlling the senses. Persons who execute religious rituals for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa are steady in devotional service, whereas persons who execute religious rituals without intending to please Kṛṣṇa are only called pious.</div></div><div id="bb1208242" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The best example of a <em>dharma-vīra</em> is Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira. A devotee once told Kṛṣṇa, “My dear Kṛṣṇa, O killer of all demons, Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, the eldest son of Mahārāja Pāṇḍu, has performed all kinds of sacrifices just to please You. He has always invited the heavenly king, Indra, to take part in the <em>yajñas</em> [sacrifices]. Because King Indra was thus absent so often from Śacīdevī, she had to pass much of her time pining over Indra’s absence, with her cheeks upon her hands.”</div></div><div id="bb1208243" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The performance of different <em>yajñas</em> for the demigods is considered to be worship of the limbs of the Supreme Lord. The demigods are considered to be different parts of the universal body of the Lord, and therefore the ultimate purpose in worshiping them is to please the Lord by partially worshiping His different limbs. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira had no such material desire; he executed all sacrifices under the direction of Kṛṣṇa, and not to take any personal advantage from them. He desired only to please Kṛṣṇa and was therefore called the best of the devotees.
