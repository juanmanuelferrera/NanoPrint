favorite plant (<em>tulasī</em>), His devotee and the periodical occasions for remembering Him. One such occasion for remembrance is Ekādaśī, which comes twice a month on the eleventh day of the moon, both waning and waxing.

There is no difference between Kṛṣṇa and His body, and therefore the transcendental features pertaining to His body are the same as Kṛṣṇa Himself. But because these qualities stimulate the devotee’s ecstatic love, they have been analyzed as separate causes of that love. To be attracted by the qualities of Kṛṣṇa means to be attracted by Kṛṣṇa Himself, because there is no real distinction between Kṛṣṇa and His qualities. Kṛṣṇa’s name is also Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa’s fame is also Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa’s entourage is also Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa and everything related with Kṛṣṇa that gives stimulation to love of Kṛṣṇa are all Kṛṣṇa, but for our understanding these items may be considered separately.</div></div><div id="bb1207502" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Kṛṣṇa is the reservoir of all transcendental pleasure.

In the beginning of His <em>kaiśora</em> age – that is, at the beginning of His eleventh year – the luster of His body becomes so bright that it becomes an impetus for ecstatic love. Similarly, there are reddish borders around His eyes and a growth of soft hairs on His body. In describing this early stage of His <em>kaiśora</em> age, Kundalatā, one of the residents of Vṛndāvana, said to her friend, “My dear friend, I have just seen an extraordinary beauty appearing in the person of Kṛṣṇa. His blackish bodily hue appears just like the <em>indranīla</em> jewel. There are reddish signs on His eyes, and small soft hairs are coming out on His body.

The <em>gopīs</em> would meditate on Kṛṣṇa’s dressing Himself just like a dancing actor and entering the forest of Vṛndāvana, marking the ground with His footprints. They meditated on Kṛṣṇa’s having a helmet with a peacock feather and wearing earrings on His ears and yellow-gold colored garments covered with jewels and pearls. They also meditated on Kṛṣṇa’s blowing His flute and on all the cowherd boys’ singing of the glories of the Lord.” That is the description of the meditation that the <em>gopīs</em> used to perform.</div></div><div id="bb1207508" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Sometimes the <em>gopīs</em> would think about His soft nails, His moving eyebrows and His teeth, which were catechu-colored from chewing pan.

His brows are just like the bow of Cupid, and they are moving just as though they were dancing. The tips of His nails are so soft – it is as if they were dried bamboo leaves. His teeth are reddish, and so it appears that He has assumed a feature of anger. Under the circumstances, where is the chance for a young girl not to be attracted by such beautiful features and not to be afraid of becoming a victim to such beauty?”</div></div><div id="bb1207509" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Kṛṣṇa’s attractive features are also described by Vṛndā, the <em>gopī</em> after whom Vṛndāvana was named.

As such, they have become bewildered and will not talk with others. All of these <em>gopīs</em> have become so affected that it is as if they had offered three sprinkles of water upon their lives. In other words, they have given up all hope for their living condition.” According to the Indian system, when a person is dead there is a sprinkling of water on the body. Thus, the statement of Vṛndā shows that the <em>gopīs</em> were so enchanted by the beauty of Kṛṣṇa that because they could not express their minds, they had decided to commit suicide.</div></div><div id="bb1207510" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">When Kṛṣṇa arrived at the age of thirteen to fourteen years, His two arms and chest assumed an unspeakable beauty, and His whole form became simply enchanting.

Our attraction for Kṛṣṇa is so intense that it is drying up the lotus flower of our discrimination, and we are losing our senses in deciding whether we shall continue as chaste women or be victimized by the beauty of Kṛṣṇa.

One <em>gopī</em> said, “With all these exquisite features of His body, Kṛṣṇa is too extraordinarily beautiful, and therefore I am always thinking of Him to protect me, because He is the killer of all demons.”</div></div><div id="bb1207516" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The idea expressed in this statement is that the <em>gopīs</em> were comparing their attraction for Kṛṣṇa to an attack by demons; and to counteract their attraction for the beauty of Kṛṣṇa, they were also turning to Kṛṣṇa hopefully, because He is the killer of all kinds of demons. In other words, they were perplexed, because on one hand they were attracted by the beauty of Kṛṣṇa, and on the other they needed Kṛṣṇa to drive away the demon of such attraction.</div></div><div id="bb1207517" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">This <em>kaiśora</em> age can be translated as adolescence. At the end of this period all the <em>gopīs</em> said, “Kṛṣṇa is the killer of the attraction of Cupid, and as such He disturbs the patience of all newly married girls. Kṛṣṇa’s bodily features have become so exquisite – it is as if they were all manifesting an artistic sense of the highest sort. His dancing eyes have dimmed the brilliance of the most expert dancer, and so there is no longer any comparison to the beauty of Kṛṣṇa.” Learned scholars therefore describe the features of His body at this time as <em>nava-yauvana,</em> newly invented youthfulness. At this stage of Kṛṣṇa’s bodily features, the conjugal love affairs with the <em>gopīs</em> and similar pastimes become very prominent.</div></div><div id="bb1207518" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">There are six features of conjugal love affairs called peacemaking, picking a quarrel, going to meet one’s lover, sitting together, separation and support. Lord Kṛṣṇa expanded an empire of these six features, of which He was the ruling prince. Somewhere He was picking quarrels with the young girls, somewhere He was scratching them with the nails of parrots, somewhere He was busy going to visit the <em>gopīs,</em> and somewhere He was negotiating through cowherd friends to take shelter of the <em>gopīs.</em></div></div><div id="bb1207519" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Some of the <em>gopīs</em> addressed Him thus: “Dear Kṛṣṇa, because of Your adolescent age, You have just become the spiritual master of these young girls, and You are teaching them to whisper among themselves.

Kṛṣṇa was beautiful because every part of His body was perfectly arranged without any defect. Such perfect bodily features of Kṛṣṇa are described as follows: “My dear enemy of Kaṁsa, Your broad eyes, Your rising chest, Your two pillarlike arms and the thin middle portion of Your body are always enchanting to every lotus-eyed beautiful girl.” The ornaments on the body of Kṛṣṇa were not actually enhancing His beauty, but just the reverse – the ornaments were beautified by Kṛṣṇa.</div></div><div id="bb1207521" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">A person is called mild when he cannot even bear the touch of the most soft thing.

At this <em>kaiśora</em> age, Kṛṣṇa’s endeavors were always bent toward arranging the <em>rāsa</em> dance as well as toward killing the demons in the forest of Vṛndāvana. While Kṛṣṇa was engaged in enjoyment with the boys and girls within the forest of Vṛndāvana, Kaṁsa used to send his associates to kill Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa would show His prowess by killing them.</div></div><div id="bb1207522" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">KṚṢṆA’S APPAREL AND GARLANDS</h2></div><div id="bb1207523" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Generally, there are four kinds of garments on the body of Kṛṣṇa: His shirt, turban, belt and wearing garments.

The different kinds of belts, combined with His enchanting smile, used to always increase the transcendental bliss of His associates. This dress of Kṛṣṇa is described as gorgeous.

In this way Kṛṣṇa dressed His hair differently at different times. As for the ointment on His body, the pulp of sandalwood generally appeared to be white, and when it was mixed with saffron dye it appeared to be yellow.</div></div><div id="bb1207525" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Kṛṣṇa used to put a <em>vaijayantī</em> garland around His neck.

Kṛṣṇa was dressed like this not only in Vṛndāvana but also on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra. Seeing such colorful dress and the garlands of different flowers, some great sages prayed, “Lord Kṛṣṇa was going to the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra not to fight, but to grace all of the devotees with His presence.”</div></div><div id="bb1207530" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><h2 class="mt-12 mb-8 text-center text-3xl">KṚṢṆA’S FLUTE</h2></div><div id="bb1207531" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">As far as His flute is concerned, it is said that the vibration of this wonderful instrument was able to break the meditation of the greatest sages.

Ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa is also aroused on the days of Ekādaśī, which are other festive days in connection with Kṛṣṇa.</div></div><div class="mt-10 flex justify-between"><a href="/en/library/nod/25/" class="inline-flex font-sans items-center px-4 py-2 mr-4 text-base font-medium bg-vb-header-top bg-opacity-30 border border-vb-header-top border-opacity-30 rounded-lg hover:bg-opacity-50"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 448 512" class="mr-2" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M257.5 445.1l-22.2 22.2c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0L7 273c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9L201.4 44.7c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0l22.2 22.2c9.5 9.5 9.3 25-.4 34.3L136.6 216H424c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24v32c0 13.3-10.7 24-24 24H136.6l120.5 114.8c9.8 9.3 10 24.8.4 34.3z"></path></svg>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</a><a href="/en/library/nod/27/" class="inline-flex font-sans items-center px-4 py-2 text-base font-medium bg-vb-header-top bg-opacity-30 border border-vb-header-top border-opacity-30 rounded-lg hover:bg-opacity-50">CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN<svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 448 512" class="ml-2" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M190.5 66.9l22.2-22.2c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0L441 239c9.4 9.4 9.4 24.6 0 33.9L246.6 467.3c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0l-22.2-22.2c-9.5-9.5-9.3-25 .4-34.3L311.4 296H24c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24v-32c0-13.3 10.7-24 24-24h287.4L190.9 101.2c-9.8-9.3-10-24.8-.4-34.3z"></path></svg></a></div></main></div><div id="footer" class="mt-auto pt-3 mb-6 text-sm text-vb-normal-text/80 text-center"><div class="px-4 py-4 w-full max-w-screen-xl mx-auto md:px-8 text-sm text-vb-normal-text/80"><div class="py-2 px-3 border border-dashed border-vb-normal-text/15 text-justify relative "><a href="/en/donate/" class="z-20 float-right my-2 ml-3 w-auto border border-vb-action-border bg-vb-action-bg hover:bg-vb-action-bg/80 rounded-md text-vb-action-text py-3 px-6 text-center disabled:opacity-50">Donate</a><span class="flex-grow">Thanks to <span>Vinod Bapat and Meenal Bapat; Mahavisnupriya dasi &amp; Gostavihari das;   Kuldip Persaud; Gagan Kangovi; Rajendra and Geeta Ramchandani; NIOS - North American Institute for Oriental and Classical Studies; Jaykumar Prabhakar; Anantha SriSimha das, Spore; Bharat Vyas; HG Lakshmipati Narayan Das; HG Ragatmika Gopika Devi Dasi; Shri Chander Mohan Gilhotra; HG Prashant Mukund Das; Shri Trilok Singh Grover; Aneesh Koppula; Ronak Talati; Bhargav Ashok; J.K Ahuja; Akiralali; Radhapati Das; Bimal Gupta; Rajasa das; Aishwarya Balaraj; Yogendra Sharad Puranik; Riya and Tejal Chopade; Devarajula Pradeep Kumar (Saroornagar, Hyderabad); Late Chetana Dilip Bhatt; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/indradyumna-swami">Indradyumna Swami</a>; Sachin; Geetanjali Nath; Mario; Joeie; Susheela and Rama Krishna Reddy Patlolla; Jai Devaki Parks; Ashmi Chakraborty; Hari-kirtana das; Ramesta das; Prasad Buddhavarapu; dasa; Kresna Sucandra; Late Mr. S.

Ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa is also aroused on the days of Ekādaśī, which are other festive days in connection with Kṛṣṇa.\"}}]}]]}]]],[\"$\",\"$L31\",null,{\"pager\":\"$2b:props:children:0:props:children:props:page:pager\",\"activeView\":\"$13:props:activeView\"}]]}]]}],\"$L32\",[\"$\",\"$L25\",null,{\"locale\":\"en\"}]]}]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"33:I[9322,[\"77\",\"static/chunks/5d4ed50a-f7c8be9a807e6ca6.js\",\"825\",\"static/chunks/31d7845b-021f9da3f9697e63.js\",\"971\",\"static/chunks/9520ad3f-48ea89eb93611988.js\",\"570\",\"static/chunks/061bc62c-731c4c5361c0b1a6.js\",\"80\",\"static/chunks/726d83c0-3c02be48ed596e6c.js\",\"462\",\"static/chunks/ccbff8d1-cc06647d0fb1d006.js\",\"244\",\"static/chunks/244-e90cecb8df7c71e4.js\",\"643\",\"static/chunks/643-27761253fa6e620a.js\",\"718\",\"static/chunks/718-a66a69860517a935.js\",\"685\",\"static/chunks/685-ce87992f230bf79b.js\",\"75\",\"static/chunks/75-09b37c6ebdea24fa.js\",\"755\",\"static/chunks/755-4e4c0d39ad776baf.js\",\"851\",\"static/chunks/851-b5ca56f5cce56349.js\",\"926\",\"static/chunks/926-7b54e3f38d066b8f.js\",\"963\",\"static/chunks/app/%5Blocale%5D/%5B...path%5D/page-089706ccb06c84ad.js\"],\"default\"]\n2e:[\"$\",\"div\",\"/en/library/nod/26/\",{\"className\":\"select-none mb-6 text-xs sm:text-base font-sans\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"$L29\",null,{\"className\":\"bg-vb-header-top/80 inline-block border border-vb-header-top border-opacity-20 rounded-md p-2 sm:px-3 mr-1 sm:mr-3 mb-2 whitespace-nowrap text-xs md:text-base text-vb-header-top-text\",\"href\":\"/en/library/nod/26/\",\"children\":\"Default View\"}],false,\"$undefined\",[\"$\",\"$L33\",null,{\"className\":\"bg-vb-header-top/30 hover:bg-vb-header-top/40 inline-block border border-vb-header-top border-opacity-20 rounded-md p-2 sm:px-3 mr-1 sm:mr-3 mb-2 whitespace-nowrap text-xs md:text-base text-vb-header-top-text cursor-pointer\",\"page\":\"$2b:props:children:0:props:children:props:page\",\"activeView\":\"$13:props:activeView\",\"children\":[[\"Dual Language \",[\"$\",\"span\",\"hideSmall0\",{\"className\":\"hidden sm:inline\",\"children\":[\"View\"]}]],false]}]]}]\n34:T41c,Vinod Bapat and Meenal Bapat; Mahavisnupriya dasi \u0026amp; Gostavihari das;   Kuldip Persaud; Gagan Kangovi; Rajendra and Geeta Ramchandani; NIOS - North American Institute for Oriental and Classical Studies; Jaykumar Prabhakar; Anantha SriSimha das, Spore; Bharat Vyas; HG Lakshmipati Narayan Das; HG Ragatmika Gopika Devi Dasi; Shri Chander Mohan Gilhotra; HG Prashant Mukund Das; Shri Trilok Singh"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1," Grover; Aneesh Koppula; Ronak Talati; Bhargav Ashok; J.K Ahuja; Akiralali; Radhapati Das; Bimal Gupta; Rajasa das; Aishwarya Balaraj; Yogendra Sharad Puranik; Riya and Tejal Chopade; Devarajula Pradeep Kumar (Saroornagar, Hyderabad); Late Chetana Dilip Bhatt; \u003ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://in.linkedin.com/in/indradyumna-swami\"\u003eIndradyumna Swami\u003c/a\u003e; Sachin; Geetanjali Nath; Mario; Joeie; Susheela and Rama Krishna Reddy Patlolla; Jai Devaki Parks; Ashmi Chakraborty; Hari-kirtana das; Ramesta das; Prasad Buddhavarapu; dasa; Kresna Sucandra; Late Mr. S.
