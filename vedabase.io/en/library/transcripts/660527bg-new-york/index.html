Before that, this planet was named as Ilāvṛta-varṣa, long, long years, millions of years before. That Jaḍa Bharata, he also lived <em>ātma-rati,</em> self-satisfied. In the beginning of his spiritual life he left this world, a very young age. When he was only twenty-four years old he left his wife, children and kingdom. It is not joke.

At that time, five hundred years before, his father&#39;s income was, I mean to say, ten millions of rupees. So there are many instances in India we have got. But this Jaḍa Bharata, he left his kingdom and family and everything, and went for spiritual realization, self-realization. Unfortunately, he was again in affection with a cub of deer, and he got next life... I think I have already narrated this story. While he died, he was thinking of that deer cub and he became a deer. <em>Yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran loke tyajaty ante kalevaram</em> [<em>Bg</em> 8.6]<em>.</em></div></div><div id="bb575192" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>[Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail.]</strong></div></div><div id="bb575193" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">That is this...

In Bengal there is a famous writer who is compared with Scott of England. So Bankim Chandra Chatterjee. Oh, all his novels are picked up from some historical facts. Historical facts.

So this <em>Mahābhārata</em> was written for such persons who are claiming to be a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> because he is born in the <em>brāhmaṇa</em> family. But according to <em>śāstra,</em> scripture, such persons are not called <em>brāhmaṇa;</em> they are called <em>dvija-bandhu,</em> &quot;a friend of a <em>brāhmaṇa.</em>&quot; So just like &quot;I am..., I am son of a high-court judge.&quot; That does not mean I am also high-court judge.

Say one pound or less than one pound drinks and goes away. The whole day was finished business. So Śukadeva Gosvāmī was doing like that.
