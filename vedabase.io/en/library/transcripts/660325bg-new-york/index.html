Otherwise why smoke is coming?&quot; Or wherever you feel some heat, although you do not see the fire directly, still, you can understand that there is fire. Because there is smoke... Because there is heat, therefore there is fire.</div></div><div id="bb573981" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Similarly, this consciousness, nobody can deny this consciousness. Now, this consciousness, because this consciousness is, therefore I am, my, I mean to say, identification or my energy is being produced in the shape of consciousness. So this consciousness proves that I am the soul present here. That is <em>Gītā&#39;s</em> philosophy, and that is the whole Vedic philosophy. Anyone, either the devotees... Just like we belong to the devotee group of philosophers. Then there are others who are impersonalists. But they, or both of them, they do not deny the presence of the soul.

They, according to them, that the combination of matter at a certain stage produces consciousness. But that philosophy, that argument, can be refuted that with matter you cannot produce consciousness. Because... Take the example of a dead man. The dead man is there. All the elements, material elements, are all there present. But you cannot revive, you cannot revoke that man to consciousness. The elements are there, the ingredients are there. Now, if you think this ingredient has been decomposed or deteriorated, then replace that ingredient.</div></div><div id="bb573983" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Just like in a machine. In a machine some part is wear and tear. It is not working; stopped. You can replace that part into new part, and the machine will work. But this is not like that. If you think that something has deteriorated in this body, therefore it has become dead, say, for example, that they say generally, due to heart failure, now, heart... Medical practitioners, they know it that heart is always pumping like this. Pumping like this. Now, can you produce heart action by artificial pumping? No. It is not possible. They give respiratory oxygen gas and so many things, but it cannot be revived.</div></div><div id="bb573984" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Therefore it is a fact that the soul, soul is different from this body. So long the soul is there, the body acts. And we, with our blunt senses, our gross senses, we cannot see the soul; therefore we deny it. Because our imperfect senses cannot see this. We cannot see so many things. So many things. Just like we are seeing this place is vacant, the outer space, but there are instruments. If you see with those instrument, you will find they are full of germs. Full of germs. Take a drop of water, as clear as possible. But if you see with microscope, you will see, &quot;Oh, it is full of germs.&quot; So imperfect vision of existence, of the existence of the soul, does not mean that there is no soul. The soul is there. Soul is there, and we can feel the presence of the soul by the symptom of consciousness. Consciousness. And that&#39;s a clear fact.</div></div><div id="bb573985" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now, we have discussed all these points.

It is due to this body. We have already discussed that... Just like take, for example, the water. Water, in summertime it is very pleasant, and wintertime, oh, it is very distressful. We are afraid. Even a drop of cold water we are afraid of. Without hot water, we cannot take our bath. Now, water as it is, it is water constitutionally, chemically or whatever it may be, but it is due to the bodily touch of the water we sometimes feel pleasure and sometimes feel distress.</div></div><div id="bb573986" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Therefore all our feelings of distress and happiness is due to this body.

Our the present life is diseased condition, so if we want to cure this disease of repeated birth and death, then we have to restrict, restrict our bodily enjoyment. Because we cannot enjoy. It is simply so-called enjoyment. Actually, you cannot enjoy this diseased condition of this body. Enjoyment, real enjoyment, means that is nonstopping. Nonstop.

Those who are endeavoring to emancipate from this material condition of life and trying to elevate to the spiritual platform, he is called <em>yogī.</em></div></div><div id="bb574029" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now, those <em>yogīs</em> are different types, but the method or process of spiritual realization may be different. Your process or my process may be a little different, but that does not hamper. The thing is that your aim is also spiritual realization. Just like generally there are three classes of spiritualist: the <em>jñānīs,</em> the <em>yogīs</em> and the <em>bhaktas.</em> <em>Jñānīs... Jñānī</em> means those who are trying to realize spiritual self through speculation of metaphysics and philosophy. They are called <em>jñānīs.</em> And <em>yogīs</em>—those who are trying to realize spiritual self by meditation and controlling the senses. <em>Yoga indriya-saṁyama.</em> This <em>haṭha-yoga</em> meditation means that our senses are engaged in varieties of work, so by that <em>haṭha-yoga</em> gymnastic, the process, the mind is concentrated into the Paramātmā, Supersoul. That means those who are too much bodily addicted, for them, this <em>haṭha-yoga</em> process is good, recommended.</div></div><div id="bb574030" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So <em>yogī...</em><em>,</em> the <em>jñānī</em> and the <em>yogī</em> and the <em>bhakta. Bhakta</em> means devotees, devotees, spiritual realization. The objective of spiritual goal is realized in three different phases: Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān. Brahman is impersonal conception of the Supreme. So these <em>jñānīs,</em> those who are proceeding through philosophical speculation and metaphysical analysis, they attain up to the impersonal Brahman. Those who are meditating by yogic process, they attain to the Paramātmā feature, or Supersoul. And those who are devotees, they attain the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div></div><div id="bb574031" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So according to <em>Bhāgavata,</em> Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal. Paramātmā feature is partial representation. How it is? Just like the sun. Sun is the chief planet, and his reflection is in every water reservoir. If you put here thousands and millions of water pots, in each pot you&#39;ll find the reflection of the sun. So Paramātmā, Supersoul, is the reflection, or partial representation, of the sun. So this is Paramātmā experience.</div></div><div id="bb574032" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">And Brahman experience is just like the sunshine. Sunshine. Sunshine is all-pervading. Everywhere sunshine is there, but still, sunshine is not important. Important is the sun globe. Similarly, Bhagavān, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, when one realizes His effulgent bodily rays, that is Brahman conception. When one realizes His reflection in everybody, <em>īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe &#39;rjuna</em> [<em>Bg</em> <em>18.61</em>].</div></div><div id="bb574033" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>[The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone&#39;s heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy.]</strong></div></div><div id="bb574034" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">God is every, in everyone&#39;s heart.

The husband is called the enjoyer, and the wife is called the enjoyed. Husband is called the predominator, and the wife is called predominated. Of course, in our India, Hindu conception of life, that a woman, a woman, according to our <em>Manu-saṁhitā</em> scripture, woman is always protected. A woman is never given independence. She is protected during her childhood by the father, and she is protected in her youth by the husband, and she is protected in her old age by her sons. That is the conception.</div></div><div id="bb574043" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">And the woman, the cow, the <em>brāhmaṇa,</em> the children—they are meant for absolute protection.

In the laws of the state, a woman, a child, a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> and cow has no fault. They have no, I mean to say, in the criminal court they are never prosecuted. That is the Hindu law. Now, therefore the whole idea is that the..., we are, we, the living entities, we are not enjoyer; we are enjoyed.</div></div><div id="bb574044" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">We...

I shall become many.&quot; Now, why He becomes many? God is one without second, but He, out of His own sweet will, He becomes many. Now, why He becomes many? He becomes many to enjoy, because without becoming many, nobody can enjoy. Just, for example, I am speaking here. Now, you are five gentleman and ladies present here. So we are enjoying these topics. But if there would have been five hundred here, people assembled, the enjoyment would have been more.

Without variety, without many things, there is no question of enjoyment. That is the original idea of enjoyment. So God became many. God became many for His enjoyment, because He is the enjoyer. We are not enjoyer; we are enjoyed. So we must know our constitutional position, that we are not enjoyer; we are enjoyed. As soon as we are convinced to this particular... Now, enjoyer and the enjoyed, both of them have got consciousness. Just like the husband and the wife: the husband is the enjoyer, the wife is the enjoyed, but both of them are conscious.

But a hand, so long attached to this body, it has got all the enjoyment of sense, touch. Touch sensation. The enjoyment of the hand can be perceived when the hand is attached with the body.
