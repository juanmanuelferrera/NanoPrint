But Arjuna, just to drive out this kind of doubts in the mind of the readers of <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>, he establishes his proposition by the authorities. He says that Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead not only by himself, Arjuna, but He is so accepted by authorities like Nārada, Asita, Devala, Vyāsa.

No. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So at least theoretically, on the statement of <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> or on the statement, assertion, of Arjuna, the person who is trying to understand the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>, we should accept Śrī Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and then, with that submissive spirit...

The first truth is what is God. It is the preliminary study of the science of God. So that science of God is explained here. Next, the constitutional position of the living entities, <em>jīva</em>. <em>Īśvara</em> and <em>jīva</em>. The Lord, the Supreme Lord, He is called <em>īśvara</em>. <em>Īśvara</em> means controller, and <em>jīva,</em> the living entities, are... <em>Jīvas</em>, the living entities, they are not <em>īśvara</em>, or the controller. They are controlled. Artificially if I say that &quot;I am not controlled, I am free,&quot; this is not the sign of a sane man. A living being is controlled in every respect. At least, in his conditioned life he is controlled.</div></div><div id="bb573085" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So in this <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> the subject matter comprehends about the <em>īśvara</em>, the supreme controller, and about the controlled living entities and <em>prakṛti</em>, the nature, the material nature. And next, the time, duration of existence of the whole universe, or this manifestation of the material nature, and the duration of time, or the eternal time; and <em>karma</em>. <em>Karma</em> means activity. Everything, the whole universe, whole cosmic manifestation, is full of different activities. The living being, especially, they are all engaged in different activities. So we have to study from the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> <em>īśvara</em>, what is God; <em>jīva</em>, what are these living entities; and <em>prakṛti</em>, what is this cosmic manifestation; and how it is controlled by time; and what are these activities.</div></div><div id="bb573086" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now out of these five subject matter, in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> it establish that the Supreme Godhead, or Kṛṣṇa, or Brahman, or Paramātmā—you may call whatever you like—but the supreme controller.

Just like the supreme controller, the Lord, He has control over the universal affairs, over the material nature, how the... It will be explained in the later chapters of <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> that this material nature is not independent.

When we see wonderful things happening in the cosmic nature, we should know that behind these wonderful manifestations there is a controller. Nothing can be manifested without being controlled. It is childish to..., not to consider about the controller. Just like a very nice motorcar with very good speed and very good engineering arrangement is running on the street. A child may think that &quot;How this motorcar is running without the help of any horse or any pulling agent?&quot; But a sane man, or an elderly person, he knows that in spite of all engineering arrangements in the motorcar, without the driver it cannot move.</div></div><div id="bb573090" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">That engineering arrangement of a motorcar, or in electric powerhouse...

Just like a husband controls the activities of his wife, similarly, the <em>prakṛti</em> is also subordinate, predominated.

Similarly, suppose I started my business with a vast amount of money, but I failed to make a successful..., I lost all the money. So I am sufferer.

Now manifestation, manifestation of <em>prakṛti,</em> may be temporary, but it is not false. Some philosophers say that this manifestation of material nature is false, but according to the philosophy of <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> or according to the philosophy of the Vaiṣṇavas, they do not accept the manifestation of the world as false.

When we hold on the conference on the <em>sanātana-dharma</em>, people belonging to some of the noneternal religious faith may wrongly consider it that we are dealing in some sectarian thing. But if we go deep into the matter and take everything in the light of modern science, it will be possible for us to see <em>sanātana-dharma</em> as the business of all the people of the world, nay, all the living entities of the universe. Non-<em>sanātana</em> religious faith may have some beginning in the annals of the human society, but there cannot be any history of the <em>sanātana-dharma,</em> because it continues to remain with the history of the living entities.</div></div><div id="bb573197" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So far living entities are concerned, we find it from the authority of the <em>śāstras</em> that living entities have also no birth or death.

It means that which is constantly with the particular object. As we have already mentioned, when we speak of fire, it is concluded at the same time that there is heat and light along with the fire. Without heat and without light, there is no meaning of the word fire. Similarly, we must find out the essential part of a living being which is always companion with him. That part of constant companion of the living being is his eternal quality, and the eternal part of the living being&#39;s quality is his eternal religion.</div></div><div id="bb573199" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">When Sanātana Gosvāmī asked Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu about the <em>svarūpa</em>—we have already discussed about the <em>svarūpa</em> of every living being—<em>svarūpa,</em> or real constitution of the living being, the Lord replied that the constitutional position of the living being is to render service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Under the circumstances, we can see that a friend serves another friend and the mother serves the son, or the wife serves the husband, or husband serves the wife. If we go on searching in that spirit, it will be seen that there is no exception in the society of the living being where we do not find the activity of service.</div></div><div id="bb573201" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The politician present his manifesto before the public and convinces voters about his service capacity.

In this way we can see no living being is exempted from the practice of rendering service to other living being, and therefore we can conclude that service is a thing which is the constant companion of the living being, and therefore it may be safely concluded that rendering of service by a living being is the eternal religion of the living being.</div></div><div id="bb573202" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">When a man professes to belong to a particular type of faith with reference to the particular time and circumstances of birth, and thus one claims to be a Hindu, a Muslim, a Christian, Buddhist, or any other sect and sub-sect, such designations are non–<em>sanātana-dharma</em>. A Hindu may change his faith to become a Muslim, or a Muslim may change his faith to become a Hindu or a Christian, etc., but in all circumstances such change of religious faith does not allow a person to change his eternal engagement of rendering service to other. A Hindu or a Muslim or a Christian, in all circumstances he is servant of somebody, and thus to profess a particular type of faith is not to be considered as <em>sanātana-dharma</em>, but the constant companion of the living being, that is, rendering of service, is the <em>sanātana-dharma</em>.</div></div><div id="bb573203" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So factually, we are related in the service relationship with the Supreme Lord.

So as she is always remembering the time of meeting with her lover at night, in spite of doing all this household work very nicely, similarly, one has to remember the supreme husband, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, always, in spite of doing his material duties very nicely.
