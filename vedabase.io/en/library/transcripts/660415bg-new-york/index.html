Then where is my stand? Where is my stand? If I leave this room, I must have another room to stay. So that is the position of Buddha. He did not say about the spirit.

Just like if you deposit in the bank one hundred dollars. So if you forget, twenty years after, you will have to take two hundred dollars. The bank will pay you, either you like to take it or not take it. Just like we have this law in this ordinary life, similarly, anything, good action or bad action, we have to suffer or enjoy the result. That is called reaction. But sacrifice for the cause of the Supreme Lord, that has no reaction. This is also bright side. There are so many wrong side also.</div></div><div id="bb574665" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> says that <em>yajña-śiṣṭāśinaḥ santo mucyante sarva-kilbiṣaiḥ. Sarva-kilbiṣaiḥ. Sarva-kilbiṣaiḥ. Kilbiṣa</em> means sinful reaction; sinful reaction, &quot;Tit for tat,&quot; good reaction or bad reaction. But one who eats after offering to the Supreme Lord, he is not under the regulation of reaction. Whatever we eat... Even we eat, that, we have got to repay for that. Now, the Sanskrit word, the flesh... Flesh, Sanskrit word, is called <em>māṁsa. Māṁsa.</em> The <em>māṁsa</em> means..., <em>mām</em> means &quot;me,&quot; and <em>sa</em> means &quot;he.&quot; So &quot;I am eating some animal; so in my next life that animal will eat me.&quot; That is called <em>māṁsa.</em></div></div><div id="bb574666" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So now, apart from animal... Don&#39;t think that those who are vegetarian, they are free from all these reaction. No. They are also. They are also. The law is that one has to repay which he is taking the help from other living entities. That is the law of <em>karma.</em> So either you eat vegetables or either you eat flesh, you have to repay that. But <em>yajña-śiṣṭāśinaḥ santo mucyante sarva-kilbiṣaiḥ.</em> The <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> says that if you eat the remnants after offering sacrifice to the Lord, then you, not only you are free from all reaction, but you do not eat anything sinful.

This is also one of the insignificant example of our activities of our life. If we act, dovetailing our actions with the Supreme Lord, then we are free from reaction. Otherwise we are bound up by the reaction. That is the law. So in order to get myself free from all reaction of my activities... Because so long I am... Because I am living entities, I have to act. Either I act spiritually, either act materially, I have to act. My activities will not stop. It is foolishness to say that &quot;I will stop my activities.&quot; No. That cannot be. Your activities will go on. If you don&#39;t act spiritually, then you&#39;ll have to act materially.

Just like in our ordinary life, if we do something at a particular moment, we cannot do other things, similarly, we have to engage ourselves fully in the spiritual life. Then our material activities will be stopped altogether, and then there will be no reaction. In spite of our acting... Just like the soldier. In spite of his killing hundreds and thousands of people, he is not to be hanged; he is to be rewarded.
