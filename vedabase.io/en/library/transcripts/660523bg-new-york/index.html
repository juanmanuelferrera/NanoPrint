Lord Kṛṣṇa says that things which are eatable, we receive by the grace of the Lord, we should acknowledge it. We should not be forgetful, that our eatables which come to us, they can be manufactured by our sweet will. No. The arrangement is so nice in the administration of nature that we shall get all our necessities of life by the grace of God, and our duty is to advance ourself in the right knowledge of our spiritual existence, without unnecessarily engaging ourself for sense gratification. That is the difference between human civilization and animal life.</div></div><div id="bb574955" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Beginning of our <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> lesson is based on that we are spirit consciousness. We are not this body. And the whole function of the human society is to be enlightened in that spiritual consciousness of life instead of wasting time in sense gratification like the animals, who are concerned with eating, sleeping, fearing and mating. That is the background of our this discussion, that we are different from the ordinary animals.</div></div><div id="bb574956" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So the common factor of animal life and human life is these four principles of bodily demands, namely that we require to eat and we require to sleep, we require some defensive measures for protecting ourself from the enemies and we require some extent of sense gratification. That is the needs of my body. They are not the needs of my self as I am, spirit soul.</div></div><div id="bb574957" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now, if I want to get rid of this bodily encagement, or the threefold miseries of material existence, then I must put myself under treatment. Just like a diseased man goes to a physician for treatment to get out of..., get relief from the sufferings of the disease, similarly, our material existence, consisting of threefold miseries and birth, death, old age and diseases, if we are actually conscious for our happiness, we must make a permanent solution of these miseries.

That developed consciousness should not be misused only for the animal propensities of life. That is the whole thing. And therefore, Lord Kṛṣṇa says that in order to reach to that stage of perfection, you should work. Your work should not be stopped.

Go on. Don&#39;t stop it, but work for the life of <em>karma-yoga.

I work whole day; I get some remuneration and enjoy for my sense gratification. That is called <em>karma,</em> in this life or that life or next life. Somebody, they make charities and other pious acts, so that in their next life they get good parentage, good education, opulence, so that they can also enjoy life. There are others also who make more advanced <em>karma</em> to get himself promoted in other planetary system, just like moon planet or Svargaloka, heavenly planet.

To get yourself promoted in higher standard of life, from A-class prisoner..., from C-class prisoner to become A-class prisoner, that is not required. <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> does not teach us that you improve your life in the respect that you are now C-class prisoner; you become A-class prisoner. No. You should not remain a prisoner. You should get yourself [out of] this prison life.</div></div><div id="bb574963" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">This material life is prison life. Just like in prison house we are forced to undergo some sort of miseries. We may agree or not agree; oh, we have to undergo. In prison life you cannot deny. The state agents are there.

This material existence is our prison life. And <em>prakṛti,</em> nature, is the forceful agent.

Now, if you want to get rid of this imprisonment, then you should begin this <em>karma-yoga, karma</em> plus <em>yoga. Yoga</em> means in connection with the Supreme.

What you have got? Everything is given by God. Anything which you possess... You have not brought anything with your birth. You have come naked from the womb of your mother. And when you shall die, you shall go naked. So whatever you possess, that is given to you for proper use.

He was fighting man in the beginning, before hearing the <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> and he remained a fighting man after hearing <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em></div></div><div id="bb574976" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Similarly, suppose you are engaged in some particular type of work before hearing this <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> And after hearing, understanding <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> you will have to remain in the same position, not that after hearing this <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> as you are kindly coming here, you will have to take a dress like me and give up your family connection and become a mendicant like me. No, no. It is not meant like that. You have to change your mentality.

Ordinary work means for..., working for our own sense gratification. &quot;I want to eat this,&quot; so I eat. I purchase from the market. &quot;Oh, this is very nice thing, very palatable to my tongue. Oh, purchase it. I shall eat it.&quot; Now, when you become conversant with the philosophy of <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> you have to think whether this thing is palatable to the tongue of Kṛṣṇa.

That&#39;s all. The whole thing is there. When you learn that thing, when you want to please Kṛṣṇa and not yourself, then you become an expert spiritualist.

Very easy. Simply we have to learn how to reach that stage of life. You haven&#39;t got to change anything. The same thing, example, that Arjuna was a military man, a householder, a family man, before hearing <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> and he remained the same family man, the same military man, but he became a great devotee of the Lord. That technique we have to learn.</div></div><div id="bb574980" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">That technique is that Arjuna, in the beginning, he did not like to fight, because he wanted to gratify his senses. He thought that &quot;I shall be happy if I do not fight with my kinsmen, because in the fighting my kinsmen will die, and I shall be sorry. So what is the use of fighting like this?&quot; That means the whole thing, whole program, is according to his own sense gratification. He did not know that this war field, this battle of Kurukṣetra, was organized by Śrī Kṛṣṇa to kill all unwanted men of the world at that time. All unwanted men of that world. That was His plan.</div></div><div id="bb574981" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now, this was disclosed to Arjuna.

But know you perfectly well that either you fight or do not fight, I do not mind. All these men who have assembled here, they are not going back home. They will be killed here. It is already settled.

Now, we have to dovetail ourself with that plan of the Supreme Lord. That is called <em>karma-yoga.</em> That is called <em>karma-yoga.</em> So Arjuna understood it, and he dovetailed himself with the supreme will of the Lord. And when he was inquired, &quot;Whether you are going or fight or not? What you have settled after hearing <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>?&quot; he said, &quot;Yes Kṛṣṇa. My illusion is now removed by Your grace, and I have decided to fight.&quot; That&#39;s all.</div></div><div id="bb574985" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now, that agreement of fighting, and in the beginning of <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> not to fight, that is the difference. In the beginning he was not in agreement with Kṛṣṇa. He made so many arguments with Kṛṣṇa against fighting. And at the end, he agreed. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said. He became a &quot;yes&quot; man. So we have to become a &quot;yes&quot; man to the Supreme Lord. That&#39;s all. That is the perfection of our spiritual life.</div></div><div id="bb574986" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now we are all &quot;no&quot; men.

Present formation of our existence is to say &quot;no.&quot; Anything godly, we say &quot;no.&quot; We shudder even by the name of God. We have come to this... We have come to a certain stage of our civilized life that we want to banish God altogether. Not only saying &quot;no,&quot; but we now prepare to agree to the point that there is no existence of God. So how much foolish we are becoming day by day in the name of advancement of civilization.

Now, we shall try to understand our position and try to say, &quot;Yes, there is God, and I am servant of God.&quot; That&#39;s all. You have to learn that thing only. No more we have to say that there is no God. We may say there is no God, [chuckles] but that does not mean that there is no God. You see? Just like a upstart. He says that &quot;I don&#39;t believe in the government. There is no government. I am all in all.&quot; So that madman say like that, that does not mean that there is no existence of government. He is a madman who says like that. So that sort of, I mean to say, madness, we should give up. We should be submissive.

So long that consciousness is there, this bodily function is going on very nicely.</div></div><div id="bb574989" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now, you are eating.

These nice machinery work is going on within your body.</div></div><div id="bb574990" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">This physiological condition is present in your body.

No. You will find the same brain is there; the same heart is there; the same stomach is there by dissection of the body. You will see the same veins. Everything is there complete. But only thing is wanting—that consciousness. Therefore everything is stopped. This is a common factor. Everyone can know it.</div></div><div id="bb574992" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Similarly, the whole cosmic manifestation which is present before you, so nicely going on, don&#39;t you think there is a consciousness behind it?

So many wonderful things are being done in the material nature. Do you think it is without being done, consciousness? No. There is also consciousness.</div></div><div id="bb574993" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Just like for the management of your own body, due to the consciousness everything is being well done, similarly, everything that you see very nicely well done in the material nature, that is also being done by superior consciousness. This is human reasoning. How can you deny it? Can you deny it?

Now, the reason is, why the supreme spirit soul expanded Himself into so many? What is the purpose? We have to understand. Now, you can take the example. What is the purpose of father&#39;s expanding himself into children? A father takes the responsibility of maintaining the children. Why? Why he takes such, I mean, a grave responsibility, a family man? That &quot;why&quot; is answered—just to have happy and enjoyable life.
