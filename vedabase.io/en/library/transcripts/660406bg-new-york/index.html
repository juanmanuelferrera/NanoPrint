Perhaps you know, every one of you, that he propounded nonviolence, and he wanted to prove nonviolence from <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> He has got an annotation of <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> and he has tried to prove that <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> there is proof, nonviolence.</div></div><div id="bb574302" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">But actually, <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> is being spoken in the battlefield, where everyone is prepared to start violence. Simply for a moment, when Arjuna was disturbed in his mind, that &quot;How can I fight with my relatives and friends and sons and grandsons and so, so many things?&quot; Bodily relations. And the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> was spoken. So that is a practical thing that <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> was practically spoken to induce Arjuna to adopt violence. Now, Mahatma Gandhi, his philosophy was nonviolence. How could he prove that <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> gives evidence of nonviolence? No.</div></div><div id="bb574303" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Therefore, anyone, Mahatma Gandhi or anyone who has got his own ulterior motive, to prove it from the topics of <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> he must adulterate it. But that is not the process of reading <em>Bhagavad-gītā. Bhagavad-gītā,</em> how to read <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> that is stated in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> When we come to the Fourth Chapter, we&#39;ll know. So anyway, apart from the process of... But rest assured, we are speaking here of the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> as it is. We are not going to add it, add in it something for fulfilling our own philosophy, our own points of view.</div></div><div id="bb574304" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now here Lord Kṛṣṇa says that if you want to get rid of this entanglement of... What is that entanglement? Now, <em>janma-bandha. Janma-bandha.</em> Oh, it is a great entanglement. People do not take it very seriously. Birth. Birth means, as soon as birth... Only the one word has been used here, <em>janma.</em> <em>Janma</em> means birth. Birth means other things. Birth means death. Birth means old age. Birth means disease. Whenever there is birth, the other things are corollary. They&#39;ll follow.</div></div><div id="bb574305" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Your birth means... A son is born. Oh, you are very glad, &quot;I have got a son.&quot; But if you study it philosophically, no, birth is not... He is not born; death is born. Because the growing of the child means he is dying. It is dying. The dying process. The very day, the very moment the child is born, the dying process begins. So we do not know that it is not birth; it is death. This is called <em>māyā.</em> This is called illusion, that death is born and we are jolly that there is birth of a child. This is called <em>māyā.</em></div></div><div id="bb574306" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So everything, from the beginning of our birth, we are illusioned. Illusioned. And that illusion is so strong that it is very, very difficult to get out of it. Whole thing is illusion. The birth is illusion. This body is an illusion. And the bodily relationship, the country is illusion. The father is illusion. The mother is an illusion. The wife is illusion. The childrens are illusion. Everything illusion. Everything illusion. And we are compact in that illusion. We are thinking that we are very much learned and very much advanced, and so many things we are imagining. But as soon as death comes, the actual fact, the beginning of death, then we forget everything. We can forget our country. We forget our relatives. We forget our wife, children, father, mother—everything gone. You see?</div></div><div id="bb574307" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">If it is a fact that I am soul, eternal, then it is a fact also that in my previous life I had my country, I had my children, I had my home, I had my father, I had my everything.

Just like you are... At night, you go to sleep. So that is a sort of death. And again you get up in the morning. So death is something like that. Death is sleeping for seven months. That&#39;s all. Without any consciousness. For three..., three months without any consciousness. Or, say, seven months. Death means forgetfulness. Just like at sleep, we forget everything: what I am, where I am sleeping, who I am, what is my identity, identification, everything forgotten. Then again, as soon as I rise up in the morning, I remember, &quot;Oh, I am such-and-such officer. I am such-and-such father, such-and-such husband, and I have got to do such-and-such things.&quot; Everything remembered. But during your sleep, you forget everything.</div></div><div id="bb574309" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Similarly, death means from the time of your leaving this body and entering into the womb of another mother, and so long another body is not developed, you remain unconscious.

Death means changing the body. We have already discussed this point. Now... But that <em>janma,</em> that birth, oh, it is stated here that it is a bondage. <em>Janma-bandha. Bandha</em> means bondage. Practically there is similarity in English. It is called <em>bandha,</em> and in English, bond. There is similarity of sound. <em>Janma-bandha.</em> So this <em>janma,</em> so long, so long your mind will be absorbed in the activities of this material world, you are sure to take birth again.</div></div><div id="bb574311" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So that activities, by intelligence, have to be purified in such a way that it will not affect you. It will not affect you. That is the tactics. This tactic... So we should be very serious. We should be serious that many, many life, many, many lives we have passed, but there was no opportunity to get out of this tribulation of birth, death, old age and diseases. Now here is a chance. Here is a chance in the human form of life. So every intelligent man should take advantage of it, and you can get assistance from these authorized books of <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> and <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavata.</em> And also expert advice, knowledge. So we should not miss this opportunity.</div></div><div id="bb574312" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">And then the question is, &quot;Suppose my, after this, after quitting this body, the present body, I don&#39;t get <em>janma.</em> Then what is happening to me?&quot; It is al... That is also stated here: <em>janma-vi..., janma-bandha-vinirmuktāḥ padaṁ gacchanty anāmayam. Anāmayam. Āmayam, āmayam</em> means contamination. <em>Āmayam,</em> contamination. So this contaminated life, as soon as we give up this contaminated life, then our promotion is in the uncontaminated atmosphere, <em>anāmayam. Anāmayam. Anāmayam</em> means Vaikuṇṭha. Vaikuṇṭha means where there is no anxiety. I think about this anxiety we explained to you in our last meeting.</div></div><div id="bb574313" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So we are..., we are getting promotion.

Nobody wants death. Nobody wants old age. Nobody wants to suffer the suf..., I mean to say, the miseries of birth. Oh, there are great miseries when you are in the womb of the mother, all tightly packed up and in a bag, suffocated bag. We do not know how do we live even. And if we put again into that position, it will be very difficult.

Just like there is superior one and the inferior one. Inferior one is subordinate to the superior one, and inferior one is to act according to the superior one. Just like it is taught here that Kṛṣṇa is the superconsciousness; He&#39;s trying to convince Arjuna that &quot;You act according to My direction, because you are individual consciousness, subordinate to Me, and I am superconsciousness.&quot; And in the last phase of <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> you&#39;ll see that He summarized, Lord Kṛṣṇa summarized, <em>sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</em> [<em>Bg</em> 18.66]:</div></div><div id="bb574327" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>[Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me.

The mother [child] is completely dependent. Similarly, as soon as we make our consciousness completely engaged in the service of the Supreme Consciousness, that is our liberated position. That is our liberated position. And in that liberated position, whatever we do, there is no reaction.

But if you act intelligently, in collaboration with the Supreme Consciousness, then you&#39;ll be free from this bondage of birth, death, old age and diseases and, in your next life... This is a training period. This life will be a training period, and as soon as you are fully trained up, then the next result will be that after giving up this body you come to My kingdom.&quot; <em>Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti kaunteya</em> [<em>Bg</em> 4.9]<em>.</em> </div></div><div id="bb574333" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>[One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.]</strong></div></div><div id="bb574334" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So this is the whole process.</div></div><div id="bb574335" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So that sort of business which will lead us to the position when we shall be dovetailed, we shall be dovetailed with the Supreme Consciousness...

If the cyclist catches the motorcar, he can also proceed with the same speed, sixty miles&#39; speed, without even pedaling. Similarly, if we can join our consciousness with the Supreme Consciousness, then our whole life becomes successful. That is the point.</div></div><div id="bb574336" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now, how to join it? The religion. This whole worldly religious process is the same, I mean to say, experimental or formulas or rituals so that one may become dovetailed with the Supreme Consciousness. Every religion. But if we become attracted by the rituals only or formula, and quarrel on that point, that &quot;Oh, my Bible says like this,&quot; or I say, &quot;No, my <em>Vedas</em> says like this,&quot; and the Muslim, Musselman, says that &quot;No, my Koran says like this. Your is not right,&quot; then we become attached to the rituals only. We forget. We forget the right point. The right point is... The whole process is how to dovetail, how to dovetail myself with the Supreme Consciousness. Going to the church, it is not a formality, but real thing is to elevate myself gradually, to dovetail myself to the supreme consciousness of God. That is the real formula. So Kṛṣṇa says that <em>karma-jaṁ buddhi-yuktā hi.</em> When we are engaged in such a way, then we get rid of this <em>janma-bandha-vinirmuktāḥ.</em> And next <em>śloka</em> is, <em>yadā te moha-kalilaṁ, gantāsi nirvedaṁ śrotavyasya śrutasya ca</em> [<em>Bg</em> 9.52]:</div></div><div id="bb574337" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>[When your intelligence has passed out of the dense forest of delusion, you shall become indifferent to all that has been heard and all that is to be heard.]</strong></div></div><div id="bb574338" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">&quot;When you are elevated to that platform, dovetailing yourself with the supreme consciousness, then there is no more requisition for understanding the scriptures or the rituals or the religious process.
