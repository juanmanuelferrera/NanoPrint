If I fight, my people will die, and their wives will become widow, and they will be adulterated, and then, by adulteration, unwanted population will increase, and who will offer <em>śrāddha</em>?&quot; <em>Śrāddha...</em> There is a ceremony of <em>śrāddha</em> according to Hindu scripture. I do not know whether you have in your Christian religion, but according to Hindu, a dead body is offered some respect every year. Just like death anniversary observed, similarly, in the family, the descendant, they offer some foodstuff after some religious ceremony. That is called <em>śrāddha.</em> And it is believed that that offering goes to the dead forefathers. So that is a family religious ceremony.

Of course, here animals are slaughtered in slaughterhouse. In..., according to Hindu system, of course, cow killing is not allowed.

Just like in, in, the Hindus, they do not eat cow&#39;s flesh. And the Muslims, they do not eat, I mean to say, hogs. Hog&#39;s flesh they do not eat. They have got some sentiment. But meat-eating is also there in the Hindu society, but that is only by goat&#39;s meat or lamb&#39;s meat. Generally goat.

It has been given some grass, and it is standing there. You see? It has no knowledge that &quot;My next turn is mine,&quot; so it is not going away. So this is animal. This is animal. A human, human being, is not so fool. If there is sign that &quot;Next time my killing is to be taken up,&quot; then he... At least he will protest or try to go away, something like that. You see?

We should not forget that we are always under suffering. There are three kinds of sufferings. I don&#39;t say about this economic problem or... That is also another suffering. But according to Vedic knowledge—or it is a fact—there are three kinds of sufferings. One kind of suffering belonging to the body and the mind. Now, suppose I am getting some headache. Now I am feeling very warm, I am feeling very cold, and so many bodily sufferings there are. Similarly, we have got sufferings of the mind. My mind is not well today. I have been... Somebody has called me something, so I am suffering.

Nature. This is called <em>adhidaivika,</em> which we have no control. In every suffering we have no control, especially... Suppose there is heavy snowfall. The whole New York City is flooded with the snow, and we are all put into inconvenience. That&#39;s a sort of suffering. But you have no control. You cannot stop snow falling. You see? [laughs] If some, some, there is wind, cold wind, you cannot stop it. This is called <em>adhidaivika</em> suffering. And the suffering of the mind and suffering of the body is called <em>adhyātmika.</em> And there is other sufferings, <em>adhibhautika,</em> attack by other living being—my enemy, some animal or some worm, so many.</div></div><div id="bb573449" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So these three kinds of sufferings are there always.

Now here Arjuna is conscious that &quot;There is a fight, and it is my duty to fight with the enemy, but there is suffering because they are my kinsmen.&quot; So he&#39;s feeling that. So unless a human being is conscious and awakened to the fact that we are always in suffering but we do not want all these sufferings, this question, such a person is required to approach a spiritual master, when he is conscious. You see? So long he is animallike, that he does not know that he&#39;s always in suffering... He does not know, he does not care, or he does not want to make a solution. Here Arjuna is suffering, and he wants to make a solution, and therefore he accepts a spiritual master.</div></div><div id="bb573450" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So when we are conscious of our sufferings, we are awakened to the suffering situation... Suffering is there. Forgetfulness or ignorance of suffering is no meaning. Suffering is there. But when one is very serious to make a solution of his suffering, then a spiritual master required.

Yes.</div></div><div id="bb573451" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So that suffering is there. It does not require any education, simply thinking that, a slight thinking, that &quot;I do not want all these suffering, but I am suffering. Why? Is there any solution? Is there...?&quot; But there is solution. All these scriptures, all these Vedic knowledge, everything... And not only Vedic knowledge. Now... Oh, why you are going to school? Why you are going to college? Why you are taking scientific education? Why you are taking law education? Everything is meant for ending our sufferings. If there was no suffering, then nobody would have taken education. You see? But he thinks that &quot;If I am educated, if I become a doctor or if I become a lawyer or if I become an engineer, I will be happy.&quot; Happy. That is the ultimate aim. &quot;I will get a good job, government job. I&#39;ll be happy.&quot; So happiness is the end of every, I mean to say, pursuance.</div></div><div id="bb573452" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So... But these mitigation of sufferings, they are temporary. Real suffering, real suffering is due to our this material existence, these three kinds of suffering. So when one is conscious about his sufferings and he wants to make a solution of this suffering, then there is necessary of a spiritual master.</div></div><div id="bb573453" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now, if you want to make a solution of your sufferings, and you want to consult a person, now what sort of person you must meet who can end your all sufferings?

The modern civilization is practically... They are evading, evading the real sufferings. They are engaged in temporary sufferings. But the Vedic system is Vedic knowledge.

But at least we must have a person as our spiritual master who represents Kṛṣṇa. And who can represent Kṛṣṇa? One who is devotee of Kṛṣṇa, in the line, disciplic succession. You see? So see here.

So He is the Lord of the senses. He is the Lord of the senses. Similarly, Govinda. Govinda... Here also, Govinda name is also there. Yes. <em>Na yotsya...

So whatever senses we have got, the actually the proprietor of the senses—not myself. The proprietor of the senses is God. Just like we are sitting in this room. This room is allotted for our sitting under some consideration of rent or whatever it may be, but this room is not ours. That&#39;s a fact. We should not consider that &quot;This is..., I am the proprietor of the room.&quot; Although I am using it to my heart&#39;s desire, as I like, that is a different thing.

Otherwise, if my hand is paralyzed, there is no remedy. There is no remedy. You see? So we are not the owner of this body, not the owner of the senses.

American land, now you are claiming as the proprietor. But is it a fact? Actually are you proprietor? Eh? Now, say, some hundreds and hundreds years, when Columbus came, so there were no Americans here, and so you were not proprietor. The land was there.

They can melt, and they can transform the shape of the metal in a different way. So that they can do, but they cannot produce iron. They cannot produce anything—wood, iron, earth, anything whatever.

He was a German Jew, and I think he was living in America. He was a great student of this <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> Hitler. Hitler was a great student of <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> And there were many scholars still reading <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> trying to understand. Just see what best depth of knowledge He has given. It is made by Kṛṣṇa. So in knowledge, in wealth, in strength, in beauty and in everything He was opulent. Therefore He is Bhagavān. You cannot accept any ordinary man as Bhagavān. So therefore Bhagavān.</div></div><div id="bb573508" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now, <em>bhagavān uvāca.</em> And because He has been accepted as the spiritual master...

Learned man does not lament over a dead body or a living body. <em>Gatāsūn agatāsūṁś ca. Asūn</em> means life. One has lost his life, and one has got his life, a body, living body and a dead body.

So this sort of lamentation is never done by a learned man. A learned man never does it.&quot; <em>Gatāsūn agatāsūṁś ca nānuśocanti paṇḍitāḥ</em> [Bg 2.11]<em>.</em> &quot;Those who are learned, one who is learned, he does not lament over the body, either a living body or dead body.
