Then, after the Battle of Kurukṣetra, this Kali-yuga has begun, Kali-yuga, this age, present age which we are passing on. In this age, this Kali-yuga will exist... From the Vedic scriptures we understand, it will exist for 400,000 years—400,000&#39;s of years, 427,000&#39;s of years..., not 27; 32. Out of that, we have passed only 5,000 years. So there is balance still, 427,000&#39;s of years, to finish this Kali-yuga, this age of...</div></div><div id="bb575131" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now, for this age... <em>Kṛte yad dhyāyato viṣṇuṁ tretāyāṁ yajato makhaiḥ.</em> Now, different ages, different methods are prescribed. So for this age, it is prescribed that <em>kalau tad dhari-kīrtanāt.</em> Whatever possible to perform in the Satya-yuga by meditation and the Tretā-yuga by offering of great, I mean to say, costly sacrifices, and in the Dvāpara-yuga by offering prayers or <em>arcanā</em> in the temples, that can be made possible easily by <em>hari-kīrtana,</em> by chanting the holy name of God.

That is not possible. Nobody can secure all those ingredients at the present moment, neither it is recommended. In the Kali-yuga it is recommended that one can perform the <em>saṅkīrtana-yajña.</em> That will give him the same result which was derived by meditation in Satya-yuga.</div></div><div id="bb575133" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu introduced this method of <em>saṅkīrtana-yajña</em> in this age.

Of course, He was born in that particular place, but He, I mean to say, distributed these missionary activities all over India. And He desired that His followers may also distribute this missionary activity in other parts of the world.

Suppose you are sitting on the bus, on the car, for two hours. For two hours, if you go on chanting, &quot;Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa,&quot; then tremendous result. So why don&#39;t you try it? There is no expenditure, there is no loss, neither loss of time, neither loss of money, neither loss of energy. There is no loss.

In that joyous state, one is situated in boundless transcendental happiness and enjoys himself through transcendental senses.

Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that by chanting this <em>kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtana,</em> Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare, the first result will be that your heart will be cleared of all dust accumulated by years and years, life after life with this material association.</div></div><div id="bb575140" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Just like we are sitting in this loft.

Because if actually Kṛṣṇa, that very name, is Kṛṣṇa, then how I can remain impure? The potency is there. It makes me at once pure. Just like as soon as there is light, there is no question of darkness. Darkness and light cannot stand together. Either it must be darkness or must be light. So as soon as there is light...
