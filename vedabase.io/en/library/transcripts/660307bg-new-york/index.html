So that is one theory.</div></div><div id="bb573605" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">But here Lord Kṛṣṇa says that &quot;Myself, yourself and all others who have come here...&quot; There were about sixty millions of people assembled in that fight. It was not a small fight. In India there was... Of course, that was also great world, world war. Just like we had experience... I think in the First World War none of you have seen, because you were all young men. And we were child. When the First World War was declared, we were all boys, schoolchildren. My age was at that time fourteen years old, in 1914, when there was fight declared between Germany and Belgium. So that was the First World War. Then Second World War was in 1939. That was also German and Englishmen, like that. But actually, this was also World War, this Battlefield of Kurukṣetra, because all the kings of the world, they joined either this party or that party.</div></div><div id="bb573606" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So there were a great assembly of all worldly kings. Now, Kṛṣṇa says that &quot;Either Myself, either yourself, or these persons who have assembled here, they are individual. They were individuals in the past, they are now individuals, and they will continue to be individual even after annihilation of this body.&quot; Now, how you&#39;ll adjust? There are two theories, that after liberation all these souls, they become one. Just like all drops of water, if you put into the sea, they become one entity; there is no distinction. And the Lord Kṛṣṇa says that &quot;No, they keep their individuality. They do not mix.&quot;</div></div><div id="bb573607" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now we are supposed... We are all laymen. We are ignorant what is actually position, what is the actual position. But we have got our discretion also. Just like every one of you has some knowledge in the history. Now, in the history in the past... Suppose you are now thirty years old or thirty-five years old, and suppose two hundred years before, the history which you read, you find that all people were individuals. And at the present you are experiencing that all individual they are. All living entities—either human being, or animals or birds or anywhere—you can see that they are individuals. Then why should you not believe that in future they will remain individuals? Do you follow? In the past they were individuals, in the present they are individuals, and why not in future they&#39;ll remain individuals?</div></div><div id="bb573608" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">It is naturally concluded that they will continue to be individuals. Even we do not have any sufficient knowledge in either of these two theories, mixing up or keeping individual, but by our own small reasoning we can understand that in the future history we have information that there were individual persons. At the present moment also, we are seeing that there are individual persons. So why not in the future? How it is that in the future they&#39;ll mix up and become one, homogeneous thing? It is quite reasonable.</div></div><div id="bb573609" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">And this conclusion is like this: just like in two hundred years before, in the month of March, the climatic position was like this. And in 1966 we find in March the climatic position is exactly the same. And in future... Naturally I conclude that in future in March the same climatic condition will be there. In astronomy also, if you find that in March, in such-and-such date, the sun rising is like this, and actually in the present March, month of March, 1966, we see the same exact time... And the whole calculation of astronomy is made like that. They prepare hundred years&#39; astronomical charts. Hundred years&#39;.</div></div><div id="bb573610" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">How they do prepare? By this calculation, that in the past it was like this, at the present it is like this, so naturally, in future it will be like this. Just like you are speaking of the imminent springtime, that the nature, how will be decorate, how springtime it will be nice, because you had past experience. So you are foretelling. It is not foretelling. From past experience you are telling that this will take place. This will take place.</div></div><div id="bb573611" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So this is another point, to understand things by our reasoning. But there are things which is beyond our reasoning. There are things, just like God, the existence of God. Of course, by our reasoning, we take it for granted that because everything has a creator... Just like we have this tape recorder before us. So we know that there is a manufacturer. Similarly, the typewriter, there is a manufacturer. In everything there is a father or manufacturer. Myself, I am..., I am created by my father. My father was created by his father. Similarly, naturally we can conclude that this whole cosmic situation, the whole material manifestation, there is one creator. You see? So these are simple reasoning. It is not very hard to understand. But at the same time, there are things which are beyond our experience, beyond our reasoning, beyond our, I mean to say, conception. Those things are called <em>acintya. Acintya</em> means inconceivable. Inconceivable.</div></div><div id="bb573612" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now, how to understand that which is beyond our conception?

But in the country, everything, every..., every place is of the same similar nature—the same jungle, the same field, the same grass. We do not know where I am going. Or in the sea. Or in the sea. I have got experience. Have you ever traveled in the sea? No. But, while I was coming from India, so everywhere I see a round only, round of water. I do not know which way the ship is proceeding.

I was seeing, &quot;Just after ten miles I shall reach,&quot; but it never reaches. So then how, what are these charts? The charts are that experienced sailors, they have made the chart. The captain was also consulting that chart because it was made by experienced sailors. That is nothing. So similarly, in calculating in which way we have to find out our salvation is to follow such liberated souls.</div></div><div id="bb573625" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So last day we had been discussing that difference between the conditioned soul and liberated soul is that a conditioned soul is imperfect in four ways. A conditioned soul is sure to commit mistake, a conditioned soul is in illusion, a conditioned soul has the tendency for cheating others, and a conditioned soul has got his senses imperfect, imperfect senses. Therefore knowledge should be taken from a liberated soul. Why this <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> is so honored? Now, this <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> was spoken in India, and it is understood that it is a scripture of the Hindus.</div></div><div id="bb573626" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">But why...? Now, you are Americans. You are also keeping this <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> and not only in America; in other countries also, in Germany. In Germany there are great, great scholars, in England, in Japan, in all countries. So why? Because it is spoken by a great personality. Apart from... We may... We Hindus, we accept Him the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but others, even not accepting Him the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they accept it as, at least, that He was a great personality. Therefore, besides the Hindu community, others, they are also consulting the knowledge.</div></div><div id="bb573627" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now, my point is that when such a great personality, and when a..., we accept Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, that His version is right. What He says, that from our practical experience we can conclude that every individual persons who were in the past individuals, they are also individuals at the present, and they&#39;ll continue to be individuals, and this is by our common sense; but it is confirmed by Śrī Kṛṣṇa, whom we call the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He is accepted as a great personality.</div></div><div id="bb573628" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">He says, <em>na tu eva ahaṁ jātu nāsam:</em> &quot;Don&#39;t think that I was not in existence.&quot; That means &quot;I was in existence,&quot; not that &quot;Just now I have come before you as God, as Śrī Kṛṣṇa. I was Śrī Kṛṣṇa in the past also, and I am Śrī Kṛṣṇa at the present. So also yourself, and so also others—all individuals. So, and at the present we are.&quot; <em>Na caiva na bhaviṣyāmaḥ:</em> &quot;And don&#39;t think that we shall not remain.&quot; <em>Sarve.</em> This <em>sarve</em> means &quot;we all,&quot; not that... <em>Sarve</em> is plural number. <em>Janādhipāḥ</em> is plural number. &quot;So they are all individual souls.&quot;</div></div><div id="bb573629" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So the individual soul continues.

It is better to accept this version without unnecessarily commenting it or interpreting it in a different way so that one... Interpretation is very bad. You see? A scripture should not be interpreted. A scripture should be taken as it is. As it is. And besides that, interpretation... When interpretation is required?

On the..., on the water, how there can be a town?&quot; So there is explanation required. Now that explanation is that &quot; &#39;On the sea&#39; does not mean &#39;in the midst of the sea,&#39; but &#39;on the bank of the sea.&#39; &quot; Here is an interpretation.</div></div><div id="bb573631" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So similarly, a thing which is very clear to everyone, so there is no necessity of interpretation. Here the, the statement of <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> as by..., spoken by Lord Kṛṣṇa is very clear, that &quot;Myself, yourself and all these people who have assembled here, they are all individual persons. And they were individual persons in the past, and at the present moment, we see that they are individual persons, and they will continue. We will continue.&quot; I may not know what they will become in the future, but because He is God, because He is the Supreme Personality, His statement should be accepted.

Is it possible? No. That is the final. That is the final. And if he says, &quot;I don&#39;t believe it,&quot; that is his foolishness. Similarly, a thing which is beyond our conception, beyond our limit of knowledge, that should be taken from the authority.</div></div><div id="bb573633" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So here is an authority, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Authority. His authority, authorityship, is accepted by all over the world. In..., in our India there are five different disciplic succession of authorities, just like the Śaṅkarites, followers of Śaṅkarācārya, and Vaiṣṇavites. Generally, they are two: Māyāvādī, impersonalists; and personalists. The personalist school, philosophers, they are divided into four: Rāmānuja-sampradāya—that means followers of Ācārya Rāmānuja; Madhvācārya-sampradāya, or the followers of Madhvācārya; Nimbārka-sampradāya, followers of Nimbārka Ācārya; and Viṣṇu-Svāmī-sampradāya.

Now, Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya, he, he is supposed, he is considered to be impersonalist. Impersonalist means he does not believe in the personal form of God. But still, he has commented in this, of this <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> <em>Śaṅkara-bhāṣya.</em> He has admitted there that &quot;Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the Personality of Godhead.&quot; He has also admitted.</div></div><div id="bb573635" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Others, they are Vaiṣṇavites.

Patañjali himself, however, has not felt the necessity of God for solving any theoretical problem of philosophy. For him, God has more a practical value than a theoretical one. This is the version of Patañjali. You see?</div></div><div id="bb573649" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Devotion to God is considered to be the great practical value, as much as it forms a part of practice of <em>yoga.</em> Those who are practicing <em>yoga,</em> they must be devotee of God. Otherwise, <em>yoga</em> will be a failure. You see? So in as much as it forms a part of practice of <em>yoga</em> and is one of the means for the final attainment of <em>samādhi-yoga</em> or the restraint of the mind... That <em>yoga,</em> <em>citta-niruddha.</em> The whole purpose of practicing <em>yoga</em> is to control the mind. Control the mind. Now, here Patañjali system, that unless you, I mean, conduct devotional service of Lord, or <em>bhakti,</em> there is no success of <em>yoga.</em> There is no success of <em>yoga.</em></div></div><div id="bb573650" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The subsequent commentators and interpreters... The difficulty is that wrong interpretation of the original text delude the audience. You see? So they are... The subsequent commentators and interpreters of the <em>yoga</em> reveals also a theoretical interest in God and discuss more fully the speculative problems as to the nature of God and the proof for the existence of God. They practically take up the speculative way. But Patañjali, as he is, he takes practically, that without devotion of God, there is no success of <em>yoga.</em> Thus the <em>yoga</em> system has come to have both a theoretical and practical interest in the divine will. According to the <em>yoga,</em> God is the Supreme Person. Now just see. This is authoritative statement. A Supreme Person. Did you ever hear...? You have been in so many <em>yoga</em> societies. Did you ever hear that God is the Supreme Person? Now just see.</div></div><div id="bb573651" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">According to the <em>yoga</em>, God is the Supreme Person, who is above all individual selves and is free from all defects. Now, the same thing, in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> also, Lord Kṛṣṇa, He, He is telling. He is informing us about the future or of the past because He is perfect. He can see both past and future. Because we are not perfect, because we do not know... Now, accepting it that you existed in..., in your, in the future... Say your age is thirty-four, thirty-five years. Can you say, thirty-six years before, where you were? You cannot say. Or suppose you live for hundred years. Can you say hundred years after where you shall be? You cannot say, because you are imperfect. Because you are imperfect.</div></div><div id="bb573652" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So God is not imperfect.

Individual, now here you see the individual. That every..., every living entity is individual. That, this particular word, that individual self, and is free from all defects. And because He&#39;s free from all defects, His statement is defectless. And therefore we must admit. My statement, because I am imperfect, my statement is also imperfect. I have no idea of the past and future. How can I say that in future you will be like this, or in the past you were like this? I cannot say. That, who is defectless—who can see past, future and present equally, and there is no defect—he can say.</div></div><div id="bb573653" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So here is the statement of the Supreme Person. We have to believe it. We cannot go out of it. If we don&#39;t believe it, then we are loser. If we don&#39;t believe it, then we are loser. He is the perfect being, who is eternal and all-pervading. Just see, all-pervading. That means, although you can see Him as a person... Just like you are present before me as a person, but you are absent in your residence. Is it not? But God is not like that. God is, although He&#39;s present, Kṛṣṇa, although He&#39;s present just before Arjuna, instructing him, but He&#39;s all-pervading at the same time.</div></div><div id="bb573654" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">A crude example: Just like at twelve o&#39;clock in the midday, you see that the sun is above your head.

Sun is a material thing. If a material entity can be so all-pervading at one and the same time, so is it not that the supreme spiritual being, He&#39;ll not be all-pervading? He is, certainly. He must be. He must be.</div></div><div id="bb573655" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So here you see that He is the perfect being who is eternal... And eternal... Eternal means that... Eternal means everything. Eternal in consciousness. Now, Kṛṣṇa says that &quot;You and Myself and all these beings were like this,&quot; because He has got eternal consciousness. He has actually experienced what I was. But because my consciousness is not eternal, I have forgotten what I was in my previous birth. Neither I can say what I shall be in my next birth. These are the distinctions. If we falsely claim that &quot;I am God. I am that supreme consciousness,&quot; it is our lunacy. It is our lunacy. We should not indulge in that way, and anyone teaching in that way, that is a cheating.

He is the perfect being who is eternal and all-pervading, omnipotent, omniscient. All individual selves are more or less subject to the affliction of ignorance. We are, all living entities except God, everyone, everyone, they are subjected to ignorance, forgetfulness. That&#39;s a fact. Ignorance, egoism. Egoism means that without having the qualification, one declares that &quot;I am God.&quot; This is egoism. Without having the qualification of God, if one declares that &quot;I am God,&quot; a foolish man, that is called egoism. Egoism, desire, aversion and dread of death. They have to do various kinds of work, good, bad and indifferent, and reap the consequences thereof. That means they are subjected to the acts of your, I mean to say, reaction of their acts. If you do some good thing, then you reap the good result. If you do some bad thing, then you reap the bad result.

Nobody should be deviated from the service of the Lord.
