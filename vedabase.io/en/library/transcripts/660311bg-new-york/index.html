Their life is for realization of the Supreme Truth. They are called <em>deva.</em> Just like in higher planets, there are also living beings. They are called <em>devatās,</em> demigods, because their magnitude of pleasure is far, far greater than ours. But because they do everything in relation with the Supreme Lord, therefore they are called <em>devatā. Devatā. Devatā</em> means demigods. And <em>asura. Asura</em> means just the opposite.

Even the ugly man can become a <em>devatā,</em> or even a beautiful man may become a <em>asura.</em> That is due to his mentality. Because, after all, the soul is pure.

In India nowadays there is a great movement for removing the caste system, because the higher caste, <em>brāhmaṇas,</em> they are claiming, due to their birthright, higher position, and the other, they are in inconvenience: &quot;Nowadays the <em>brāhmaṇas</em> are doing the same thing, what we are doing, a <em>śūdra.</em> Why he should claim?&quot; So there is that quarrel.

Just like you are within this shirt and coat, similarly, I am also within this body, this gross body and the subtle body. This gross body is made of this earth, water and fire, air and ether, this gross body, this our whole material body. Now, in this Earth, in this planet, earth is prominent. Anywhere, the body, material body, is made of these five elements: earth, water, fire, air and ether. These are the five ingredients.</div></div><div id="bb573912" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Just like this building. This whole building is made of earth, water and fire. You have taken some earth, and then you have made bricks and burnt into the fire, and after mixing the earth with water, you make a shape of brick, and then you put into the fire, and then when it is strong enough, then you set it just like a big building. So it is nothing but a display of earth, water and fire, simply. That&#39;s all.</div></div><div id="bb573913" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Similarly, our body is also made in that way: earth, water, fire, air and ether. Air... Air is passing, we breathing. You know that the air is always there. This, this outer skin is earth, and there is heat in the stomach. Without heat, you cannot digest anything. You see? As soon as the heat is diminished, your digesting power becomes bad. So many things. This is arrangement.</div></div><div id="bb573914" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now, in this planet we have got this body which is where earth is very prominent. Similarly, in other planets, other planets, somewhere water is very prominent, somewhere fire is very prominent. In the sun planet, the bodies there... There are also living entities, but their body is so made that it is fiery. They can exist in the fire. They can exist in the fire. Similarly, Varuṇaloka, in the Venus, all these planets, they have got different types of body. Just like here you can experience that in the water the aquatics, they have got a different type of body. For years and years together there are aquatic animals, they are within the water. They are very comfortable. But the moment you&#39;ll drag it to the land, it dies.</div></div><div id="bb573915" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Similarly, you are very comfortable on the land, but the moment you are put into the water, you die. Because your body, bodily construction is different; his body, the bodily construction different; the bird&#39;s bodily... The bird, heavy bird, it can fly, but, God&#39;s made flying instrument. But your man-made instrument, it crashes. Crashes. You see? Because artificial.</div></div><div id="bb573916" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So this is the arrangement. Every living being has got a particular type of body. <em>Dehino &#39;smin yathā dehe.</em> And what is the nature of that body? Now, here the matter is being explained that how we change our body, how... But, but, but, because that is a difficult problem for us, because we are engrossed with the idea of identifying this body with the soul. Now, the first A-B-C-D of spiritual knowledge is to understand that &quot;I am not this body.&quot; Unless one is firmly convinced that &quot;I am not this body,&quot; he cannot make progress in the spiritual line. So the first lesson in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> is taken in that way. So here it is, that <em>dehino &#39;smin.</em> Now, <em>dehī,</em> the soul, soul. <em>Dehī</em> means soul. One who has accepted this body, material body, he&#39;s called <em>dehī.</em> So <em>asmin,</em> he is there. He is there, but his body is changing. The body is changing.</div></div><div id="bb573917" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now, our body was formed in the womb of my mother. That is also described in the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavata,</em> the physiology, physiology of this body. It is said there that according to our <em>karma</em> we are put through the semina of the father, injected into the womb of the mother. And the father&#39;s secretion and the mother&#39;s secretion, that is emulsified and takes the form of a pea, and that pea gradually develops. In three months, there are holes, nine holes: the eyes, ears, nose and the..., just like we have got nine holes. And in seven months the whole body is complete. Then the child gets consciousness. And ten months it is just ready to come out.</div></div><div id="bb573918" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So by air, the same air, forces the child to come out of the mother&#39;s connection. Because so long a child remains within the womb of the mother, she, she takes through the mother, so there is intestinal connection between the child and the mother. So after the child comes out, the intestinal connection is cut away and he becomes a separate identity. That is the law.</div></div><div id="bb573919" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now, the..., our point is, as from the mother&#39;s womb, from the very beginning of our birth as the body develops, develops, similarly, after coming out of the body, it also develops. But the spirit spark is there, the same; the body takes development. So... Now, that development—from this small child, he becomes a bigger child, then he becomes a boy, then becomes a youth, then gradually a old man like me. And then gradually, when this body is no longer useful, then it is..., it has to be given up and another body has to be taken—this is the process of transmigration of soul. I think there is no difficulty to understand this simple process.</div></div><div id="bb573920" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now, the soul is there, and the body&#39;s transforming every moment, every moment, imperceptibly. Just like if you have seen some, some your friend&#39;s child small, and after five years, you go to that friend&#39;s house and see the child: &quot;Oh, you have grown so big? You have grown so big?&quot; But the father, mother cannot see. Because they are seeing daily, they do not see that &quot;How my child is growing, daily,&quot; but a man who comes all of a sudden after five years, he says, &quot;Oh, the child is grown up.&quot;</div></div><div id="bb573921" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So imperceptibly we are changing our body every moment. Every moment. That is also medical science, that we are changing our blood corpuscles every moment. You see? Similarly, what is the difficulty to understand that..., that the soul transmigrates from one body to another? It is very nicely explained here: &quot;As the owner of the body is there within the body, but the body is changing, one after another, one after another...&quot; <em>Dehino &#39;smin yathā dehe, kaumāraṁ yauvanam.</em></div></div><div id="bb573922" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Here two examples are given: <em>kaumāram...

And then, after forty years, one becomes old. This is the process of this body. But it will be later on explained the spirit soul within this body, that is not changing.

I do not know what is going in your soul. We are all individual souls. But according to Māyāvādī philosophers, they say, &quot;Just like the sky, the ether&quot;—ether is everywhere, within your body and within mine, within everyone&#39;s—that &quot;the ether has taken a form due to this particular body. But when the body is vanquished, the ether, I mean to say, amalgamates with the greater ether.&quot; This is called <em>ghaṭākāśa-poṭākāśa.</em> <em>Ghaṭākāśa-poṭākāśa</em> means this <em>ākāśa</em> is here.</div></div><div id="bb573942" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now, <em>ākāśa</em> means ether.

The eyelid is always attached with my eye, but I cannot see.</div></div><div id="bb573959" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So our power of using the senses, that is very limited. So we should not depend only on the senses. <em>Pratyakṣa.</em> It is called <em>pratyakṣa-anumāna.</em> There are three kinds of evidences: <em>pratyakṣa, anumāna</em> and <em>aitihya. Pratyakṣa</em> means that you can directly perceive. That is called <em>pratyakṣa.</em> And <em>anumāna, anumāna</em> means you can conjecture, make an..., &quot;It may be like this. It may be like this. Perhaps it is like this.&quot; This is called <em>anumāna.</em> And the other evidence is <em>aitihya. Aitihya</em> means to take evidences from the authority.</div></div><div id="bb573960" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So according... Out of these three evidences, this <em>aitihya</em> evidence, just like we are taking instruction of <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> sound, sound vibrated by the greatest personality, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. That sort of <em>pramāṇa</em> is acceptable. That is the best. This is the best way of acquiring knowledge. Because so far direct evidence is concerned, it is impossible. Because our senses are so imperfect, we cannot have anything. We can..., we can have some direct experience of certain things, but not for all, especially for these spiritual things, which is beyond our experience.</div></div><div id="bb573961" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So <em>pratyakṣa</em> means direct evidence you cannot have. And <em>anumāna</em> means speculation, simply, &quot;It may be like this. It may be like that,&quot; oh, that is also imperfect, because our thinking power is also limited, because our senses are limited. So our thinking power, mind, is one of the senses. Out of the ten, mind is considered to be the eleventh sense. There are five <em>karmendriya</em> and..., five sensory organs and working organs, ten, and the mind is the chief. So mind is also considered as one of the senses, the chief senses. You see? So because it is sense, it is imperfect.</div></div><div id="bb573962" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So by mental speculation we cannot have into a right conclusion, by mental speculation. Those are simply speculating on mind, they can make some progress to a certain extent, but they cannot reach the ultimate goal. It is not possible by mental speculation, neither it is possible by direct evidence. The only, only possible evidence is authority. Authority.</div></div><div id="bb573963" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Just like yesterday also I gave you that example. Just like if a child asks his mother that &quot;Who is my father?&quot; now the mother says, &quot;Here is your father.&quot; Now, if the child says, &quot;I don&#39;t believe it,&quot; so he has no other source of knowledge. Except the fath..., mother&#39;s version, that &quot;Here is your father,&quot; he has no other alternative to know who is father. It is such a thing that neither he can imagine, speculate, &quot;Oh, he may be my father, he may be my father, he may be my father.&quot; Lots of father he can gather. That is not possible. And neither it is possible for direct perception. The only possibility is the mother&#39;s evidence.</div></div><div id="bb573964" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Similarly, as the mother is authority for the child, similarly, the <em>śruti,</em> the <em>Vedas,</em> they are called mother, mother of knowledge. So for such spiritual knowledge we have to accept the authority. Now here, the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> is authority. It is accepted... Don&#39;t think that it is a scripture of the Hindus. No. It is for all human being. There is reason. There is science. There is philosophy. It is not dogmatic. So it is to be understood simply. And not only that; actually it is accepted by all countries. Not only in your country, but in other countries also, <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> is accepted as one of the greatest book of authority.</div></div><div id="bb573965" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So this is the process. You should know it that the spirit soul, as it is stated in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em></div></div><div id="bb573966" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic">dehino &#39;smin yathā dehe<br/>kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā<br/>tathā dehāntara-prāptir<br/>dhīras tatra na muhyati</div></div><div id="bb573967" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-right">[<em>Bg</em> <em>2.13</em>]</div></div><div id="bb573968" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><strong>[As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death.

Death is nothing but the final change of this present body. That&#39;s all. And our death condition is for seven months only. As soon as I leave this body, at once I am injected into other&#39;s mother&#39;s body according to my <em>karma.</em> I may be injected to a queen&#39;s womb; I may be injected to a dog&#39;s mother. You see? That is due to my <em>karma.</em> You see? The father is present there. The dog father is present there. The king father is present there. The <em>devatā</em> father is present there. There is no scarcity of father, but it will depend on my <em>karma</em> which kind of father I shall take shelter. You see?</div></div><div id="bb573970" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So these things are..., have to be accepted from the authoritative scriptures like <em>Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā</em> and <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavata.</em> And then it will be possible for us to understand the things as they are. There is no question of sectarianism. There is no question of this &quot;ism&quot; or that &quot;ism.&quot; It is a question of pure knowledge.</div></div><div id="bb573971" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Thank you very much.
