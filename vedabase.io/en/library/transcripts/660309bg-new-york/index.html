Because I am limited, so I think twice, whether I am able to keep a wife, then whether I am able to maintain my children. These things are consideration.

They, they practically, those who are pure devotees, they do not want any kind of <em>mukti.</em> They do not, even they are offered. They are simply after the service of the Lord.

Similarly, from the distance of ninety millions of miles you can see the sun just like a ball, but it is not ball.

There are living beings. After all, the whole material world is made of five elements: earth, water, fire, air and ether. Now these five elements, in some planet you&#39;ll find earth predominant.

Similarly, you have experience that you cannot live in the fire. That does not mean that in the sun planet there is no living entities. There are living entities. Because in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> you&#39;ll find that living soul, as it is, it is not burnt by fire. It is not burned by fire. Because it is spiritual.
