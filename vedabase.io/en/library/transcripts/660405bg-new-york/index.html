But when he begins to walk independently, then he doesn&#39;t require any help. Similarly, to learn this art, &quot;Whether I am acting on the spiritual platform or on the material platform?&quot; you require a spiritual master, guide. And this is called <em>dvija,</em> or the second birth. When you catch hold of the bona fide spiritual master just to guide you to act on the spiritual platform, then your second life begins.

He&#39;s as equal to your Rockefeller family.

And the..., that property, out of the property, one of the land is leased out to this Singhania Organization business. So they pay rent to the Deity. You see? So similarly, the Deity has large income. And they spend also in so many ways.

And the order is that each and every family member must go every day and pay respect to the Deity. And if somebody is absent one day, then he must be fined. A fine is imposed. The, the big brother, Sir Padampat Singhania, if he&#39;s absent one day to pay respect to the Deity, he&#39;s fined ten rupees, or ten dollars. You see? And, and next day the <em>brāhmaṇa,</em> or the <em>pūjārī,</em> the worshiper engaged, he goes to collect the fine. He presents, &quot;Yes, yes. I am sorry. Yes. Here is my fine.&quot; [laughs] So of course, this is self-imposed, but the idea is that they are spiritually conscious in this way: &quot;Oh, I did not go yesterday to offer my respect to the Deity, Kṛṣṇa. So I must pay fine.&quot; This is also spiritual consciousness.

With all his duty or her duties during the daytime, she or he always thinks, &quot;Oh, when that moment will come when we shall meet together?&quot; That means the mind is always there.
