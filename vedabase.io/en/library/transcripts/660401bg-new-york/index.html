The arrangement is so. Just like in a pond if you drop a stone, the circle, the circle begins to enlarge, enlarge, enlarge, enlarge, enlarge, and so similarly, we catch the radio vibration.

A common example can be cited in this connection. Suppose you are working for your master. You are working in a firm for selling something. The master says that &quot;You go and find out some customers for this particular thing.&quot; You go out. You go out. Now, you sincerely work for it. Suppose you get business worth 100,000 dollars or something like that. And suppose one day you don&#39;t get any business. Now, the day in which you got some business and on the day in which you did not get any business, it doesn&#39;t matter. Your connection with the master is there, so you get your salary. When the profit is 100,000&#39;s of dollars, you don&#39;t expect any profit out of it. And when there is no business, there is no loss on your part. <em>Siddhy-asiddhyoḥ.

So if you work for it, so you have nothing to enjoy or suffer out of the reaction because you shall work under My instruction.&quot; That is the... If we work on behalf of the Supreme Lord, then that is called <em>yoga-sthaḥ.</em> So our work is also not stopped, and at the same time I am situated in the spiritual platform.</div></div><div id="bb574219" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">That technique is taught by Lord Kṛṣṇa. <em>Yoga-sthaḥ kuru karmāṇi tyaktvā saṅgaṁ dhanañjaya:</em> &quot;You do not be attached with the profit and loss of anything, but you simply do your duty.

Now, the rod is practically killing the snake, but actually the rod is not responsible, because the man who has taken the rod, who is killing the snake, he is responsible for killing the snake, not the rod. So we have to become the rod in the hand of the Supreme. Then all the reaction of our work will be... I will not be responsible for the reaction; the Lord will be responsible for that.

I have already described to you the four divisions of social system and four division of spiritual orders. Now, all the social system and orders, they are so designed that everyone is working for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. In a higher section of the social order, just like the <em>brāhmaṇas</em> and the <em>kṣatriyas</em> and the <em>vaiśyas,</em> the system is that in every household they establish the Deity, I mean to..., the form of the Supreme Lord. Either in picture or in idol, they establish that.</div></div><div id="bb574222" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now, what is the function in your household affairs? You have got wife, you have got children, and you require some money. And the activities in householder affair is that you have to get some store from the market, and they are brought in your house and they are stocked, and in due time they are cooked, and you take your foodstuff and then go to your work. This is generally the whole system of household work.</div></div><div id="bb574223" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now here, the <em>yoga-sthaḥ kuru karmāṇi...</em> In India there are many families still, at least in my family, when I was family man, I was also doing this, that the Deity, Lord Kṛṣṇa, the <em>mūrti—mūrti</em> means Deity, or the idol of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa—established in a room. That is called the God&#39;s room. The God&#39;s room. So our duty is to rise early in the morning and open the door of the God&#39;s room, offer Him some prayers and some <em>kīrtana,</em> and then cleanse the room and then begin our daily duty, take our breakfast and... The whole idea is that &quot;The proprietor of this house is the Supreme Lord, and we are all workers.&quot; The whole idea is, &quot;The proprietor is the Supreme Lord, and we are all workers.&quot; Now, I am going to my office, to my work, to earn some money, because without money my household affairs cannot be run. So I am thinking that &quot;This money is required; otherwise God&#39;s service will be stopped.&quot; So in earning that money in my office or in my workshop, my God consciousness is there. Therefore, even in earning, whatever may be the process, you are <em>yoga-sthaḥ</em>; you are situated in<em> yoga.</em></div></div><div id="bb574224" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now, you get your money, then you go to the market. You are thinking, &quot;Oh, this is a very nice thing. Oh, it can be offered to Lord Kṛṣṇa. It can be offered to Lord Kṛṣṇa.&quot; Just like sometimes you bring some fruits for me, thinking, out of your love, &quot;Oh, Swāmījī will take this—you like it.&quot; So the consciousness is love. Out of love, you think of Swāmījī. Similarly, Swāmījī is thought because he is in relation with God. So similarly, we can think of also God. God or anything, relation with God, that is God consciousness. Just like electric charge. Anything connected with the powerhouse and anything later on connected with that powerhouse link—everything is surcharged with electricity.</div></div><div id="bb574225" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So our life should be so formed that in our every activity there will be God consciousness. That is the technique of <em>yoga-sthaḥ.</em> You haven&#39;t got to separately being seated in meditation as <em>yoga,</em> generally as we understand. Now, how much you can devote your time to meditation? Suppose one hour in the morning or one hour in the evening you can devote. But if you mold your life in such a way that always, twenty-four hours, you are in meditation, that is the platform of <em>yoga-sthaḥ kuru karmāṇi.</em></div></div><div id="bb574226" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">I am earning for the Supreme Lord. Then, when I earn, I bring things for cooking, I am thinking, &quot;Oh, this thing will be cooked for Lord.&quot; Now, your wife cooks, and she is also very clean because it is being cooked for Lord Kṛṣṇa. You see? Now, as far as I am concerned here, I also cook myself my food and offer to Kṛṣṇa, and therefore I ask my friends that unless it is offered to Kṛṣṇa, you please do not take it. You see? Sometimes I see that in your country, while cooking, they taste. They taste. But I request them that don&#39;t taste before the cooking is finished. After cooking is finished and when it is offered to the Deity, then you take as much as you like. As much as you like. So that means there is God consciousness, that &quot;This thing is being cooked for the Lord.&quot;</div></div><div id="bb574227" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The cooking will go on. If you don&#39;t think of God, you require cooking, because you want to eat. The cooking is there in the program. But if you think that this cooking is done for God, then your God consciousness is there. The cooking you cannot avoid. As a householder you have to cook for yourself, you have to cook for your children, you have to cook for somebody else or for your own self. Just like I am cooking. I have no here family or children, but I am cooking for myself. So cooking you cannot stop. But if you cook with the understanding that &quot;This foodstuff is being cooked for the Lord. The Lord may be offered first; then we shall take,&quot; this is God consciousness. This is God consciousness.</div></div><div id="bb574228" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">But is it very difficult thing? Anyone can accept this. Anyone can do it. It is not... Because your cooking business is not stopped. Simply the mode of thinking has to be changed. That&#39;s all. A small technique, that &quot;I am earning for God. I am cooking for God. I am eating also for God. I am eating also for God.&quot; How is that eating you are...? &quot;Now, because my body is dedicated to the service of the Lord, if I don&#39;t eat sufficiently to keep my body fit, then how can I work?&quot; So your eating is also God consciousness. Your sleeping is also God consciousness. So that is the way. We have to mold our life&#39;s activities.</div></div><div id="bb574229" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now, when I think that &quot;I have to keep this body fit for working for God,&quot; so then that is not, I mean to... That is not bodily conception of life. Just like when you think that &quot;My car has to be kept very nicely so that I can take nice work for it,&quot; then you are not identified with your car; you simply want to take some service of the car. Similarly, if you think that &quot;This body is required for acting, for working on behalf of the Supreme Lord; therefore I must keep the body fit to work,&quot; so that is not your identification with the body. But if I use this body for sense gratification and therefore I make my body stout and strong to enjoy sense enjoyment, that is the cause of my bondage. So it is a simple technique, and we have to understand it and we have to act it on the program as they have been made by experienced devotees. Experienced devotees.</div></div><div id="bb574230" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Now, another thing. Take this... See the advantage of God consciousness. Now, if you have got determination that &quot;I shall not take anything which is not offered to God...&quot; Because your life is meant for God&#39;s service. You earn for God; you cook for God; you eat for God. Therefore the whole life is like that. Now, if you are cooking for God, if you are purchasing stores for God, then you have to know what sort of things can be offered to God, because... Always remember that you are going to the store not for your own purpose. You find in later chapters that <em>pacanti te aghaṁ pāpām...</em> Er, no. The idea is that anyone who is doing everything for the sake of the Lord, he is freed from the reaction, but anyone who is doing anything on his own account, he is being entangled in that action and reaction. So that is the technique of becoming <em>yoga-sthaḥ.

But the same India was producing so much grains, even during British time, that many thousands and thousand tons of rice were being exported from India to other countries. You see? That I have seen.

Even Pakistan, it has divided; it is now a part of India. But they have also their state religion. But unfortunately India has no state religion. That means deliberately they are trying to disconnect with God relation, godly relation. But in the same India...

Industry does not mean really economic improvement. Real economic improvement means what you produce from the land. That requires God help. Without raw materials, even your industry cannot go on. Just like I have cited the example of paper. Now paper..., nowadays paper is made from wood. Now, if there is no sufficient... Now you have got in your America sufficient wood, so you can make, produce paper in large quantity. But suppose the woods are finished.

And from the, I mean to, the egg, the cub comes out, the offspring comes out—the second birth. Therefore birds are also sometimes called <em>dvija.</em> Similarly, human and higher status of life, they must have twice-born. Therefore the <em>brāhmaṇas,</em> the <em>kṣatriyas</em> and the <em>vaiśyas,</em> this thread, this thread is the sign that &quot;My second birth has been done.&quot; This is the emblem.

And after being <em>dvija, veda-paṭhāt bhaved vipraḥ. Veda-paṭhāt</em> means this knowledge, scriptural knowledge, Vedic wisdom. By studying this Vedic wisdom he becomes a <em>vipra.</em> And after studying, when he knows, &quot;Oh, I am spiritual.
