Of course, I heard this story from my professor when I was a student of logic in my I.A. class. And this example was given by my professor, Dr. Purnachandra Sena, I still remember, that when first railway was started from Howrah to Burdwan, about sixty-four miles, during British period, say about two hundred years before, now the cultivators on both sides of the line, they were seeing the railway engine going with wonder: &quot;Oh!&quot;</div></div><div id="bb574073" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">So somebody...

If you simply stop the child that &quot;Don&#39;t play,&quot; by threatening or by some other way, you can stop him artificially for some time. But as soon as he gets opportunity he will again play.

Similarly, fighting is also not bad if it is done for the supreme cause. Anything which is done for the supreme cause, that is transcendental. That is above, I mean to say, our mundane calculation.
