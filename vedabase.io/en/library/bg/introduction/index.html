Of course there are many commentaries in English on the <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> and one may question the necessity for another one. This present edition can be explained in the following way. Recently an American lady asked me to recommend an English translation of <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> Of course in America there are so many editions of <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> available in English, but as far as I have seen, not only in America but also in India, none of them can be strictly said to be authoritative because in almost every one of them the commentator has expressed his own opinions without touching the spirit of <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> as it is.</div></div><div id="bb48" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><p data-block-key="9z83o">The spirit of <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> is mentioned in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> itself. It is just like this: If we want to take a particular medicine, then we have to follow the directions written on the label. We cannot take the medicine according to our own whim or the direction of a friend. It must be taken according to the directions on the label or the directions given by a physician. Similarly, <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> should be taken or accepted as it is directed by the speaker Himself. The speaker of <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> is Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. He is mentioned on every page of <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagavān. Of course the word <em>bhagavān</em> sometimes refers to any powerful person or any powerful demigod, and certainly here <em>bhagavān</em> designates Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa as a great personality, but at the same time we should know that Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as is confirmed by all great <em>ācāryas</em> (spiritual masters) like Śaṅkarācārya, Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Nimbārka Svāmī, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and many other authorities of Vedic knowledge in India. The Lord Himself also establishes Himself as the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> and He is accepted as such in the <em>Brahma-saṁhitā</em> and all the <em>Purāṇas,</em> especially the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</em> known as the <em>Bhāgavata Purāṇa</em> (<em>kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam</em>). Therefore we should take <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> as it is directed by the Personality of Godhead Himself.

But in the course of time it has become lost. Consequently the Lord has to speak it again, this time to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra.</div></div><div id="bb53" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">He tells Arjuna that He is relating this supreme secret to him because Arjuna is His devotee and His friend. The purport of this is that <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> is a treatise which is especially meant for the devotee of the Lord. There are three classes of transcendentalists, namely the <em>jñānī,</em> the <em>yogī</em> and the <em>bhakta,</em> or the impersonalist, the meditator and the devotee. Here the Lord clearly tells Arjuna that He is making him the first receiver of a new <em>paramparā</em> (disciplic succession) because the old succession was broken. It was the Lord’s wish, therefore, to establish another <em>paramparā</em> in the same line of thought that was coming down from the sun-god to others, and it was His wish that His teaching be distributed anew by Arjuna. He wanted Arjuna to become the authority in understanding the <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> So we see that <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> is instructed to Arjuna especially because Arjuna was a devotee of the Lord, a direct student of Kṛṣṇa, and His intimate friend. Therefore <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> is best understood by a person who has qualities similar to Arjuna’s. That is to say he must be a devotee in a direct relationship with the Lord. As soon as one becomes a devotee of the Lord, he also has a direct relationship with the Lord. That is a very elaborate subject matter, but briefly it can be stated that a devotee is in a relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in one of five different ways:</div></div><div id="bb54" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">1.

Of course there is a gulf of difference between this friendship and the friendship found in the material world. This is transcendental friendship, which cannot be had by everyone. Of course everyone has a particular relationship with the Lord, and that relationship is evoked by the perfection of devotional service. But in the present status of our life, not only have we forgotten the Supreme Lord, but we have forgotten our eternal relationship with the Lord. Every living being, out of the many, many billions and trillions of living beings, has a particular relationship with the Lord eternally. That is called <em>svarūpa.</em> By the process of devotional service, one can revive that <em>svarūpa,</em> and that stage is called <em>svarūpa-siddhi</em> – perfection of one’s constitutional position. So Arjuna was a devotee, and he was in touch with the Supreme Lord in friendship.</div></div><div id="bb60" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">How Arjuna accepted this <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> should be noted.

These are great personalities who distribute the Vedic knowledge as it is accepted by all <em>ācāryas.</em> Therefore Arjuna tells Kṛṣṇa that he accepts whatever He says to be completely perfect. <em>Sarvam etad ṛtaṁ manye:</em> “I accept everything You say to be true.” Arjuna also says that the personality of the Lord is very difficult to understand and that He cannot be known even by the great demigods. This means that the Lord cannot even be known by personalities greater than human beings. So how can a human being understand Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa without becoming His devotee?</div></div><div id="bb68" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Therefore <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> should be taken up in a spirit of devotion. One should not think that he is equal to Kṛṣṇa, nor should he think that Kṛṣṇa is an ordinary personality or even a very great personality. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So according to the statements of <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> or the statements of Arjuna, the person who is trying to understand the <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> we should at least theoretically accept Śrī Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and with that submissive spirit we can understand the <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> Unless one reads the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> in a submissive spirit, it is very difficult to understand <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> because it is a great mystery.</div></div><div id="bb69" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Just what is the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>?

Every man is in difficulty in so many ways, as Arjuna also was in difficulty in having to fight the Battle of Kurukṣetra. Arjuna surrendered unto Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and consequently this <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> was spoken. Not only Arjuna, but every one of us is full of anxieties because of this material existence. Our very existence is in the atmosphere of nonexistence. Actually we are not meant to be threatened by nonexistence. Our existence is eternal. But somehow or other we are put into <em>asat. Asat</em> refers to that which does not exist.</div></div><div id="bb70" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Out of so many human beings who are suffering, there are a few who are actually inquiring about their position, as to what they are, why they are put into this awkward position and so on. Unless one is awakened to this position of questioning his suffering, unless he realizes that he doesn’t want suffering but rather wants to make a solution to all suffering, then one is not to be considered a perfect human being. Humanity begins when this sort of inquiry is awakened in one’s mind. In the <em>Brahma-sūtra</em> this inquiry is called <em>brahma-jijñāsā. Athāto brahma-jijñāsā.</em> Every activity of the human being is to be considered a failure unless he inquires about the nature of the Absolute. Therefore those who begin to question why they are suffering or where they came from and where they shall go after death are proper students for understanding <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> The sincere student should also have a firm respect for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a student was Arjuna.</div></div><div id="bb71" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Lord Kṛṣṇa descends specifically to reestablish the real purpose of life when man forgets that purpose. Even then, out of many, many human beings who awaken, there may be one who actually enters the spirit of understanding his position, and for him this <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> is spoken. Actually we are all swallowed by the tigress of nescience, but the Lord is very merciful upon living entities, especially human beings. To this end He spoke the <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> making His friend Arjuna His student.</div></div><div id="bb72" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Being an associate of Lord Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna was above all ignorance, but Arjuna was put into ignorance on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra just to question Lord Kṛṣṇa about the problems of life so that the Lord could explain them for the benefit of future generations of human beings and chalk out the plan of life. Then man could act accordingly and perfect the mission of human life.</div></div><div id="bb73" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The subject of the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> entails the comprehension of five basic truths. First of all the science of God is explained, and then the constitutional position of the living entities, <em>jīvas.</em> There is <em>īśvara,</em> which means the controller, and there are <em>jīvas,</em> the living entities which are controlled. If a living entity says that he is not controlled but that he is free, then he is insane. The living being is controlled in every respect, at least in his conditioned life. So in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> the subject matter deals with the <em>īśvara,</em> the supreme controller, and the <em>jīvas,</em> the controlled living entities. <em>Prakṛti</em> (material nature) and time (the duration of existence of the whole universe or the manifestation of material nature) and <em>karma</em> (activity) are also discussed. The cosmic manifestation is full of different activities. All living entities are engaged in different activities. From <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> we must learn what God is, what the living entities are, what <em>prakṛti</em> is, what the cosmic manifestation is, how it is controlled by time, and what the activities of the living entities are.</div></div><div id="bb74" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Out of these five basic subject matters in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> it is established that the Supreme Godhead, or Kṛṣṇa, or Brahman, or the supreme controller, or Paramātmā – you may use whatever name you like – is the greatest of all. The living beings are in quality like the supreme controller. For instance, the Lord has control over the universal affairs of material nature, as will be explained in the later chapters of <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> Material nature is not independent. She is acting under the directions of the Supreme Lord. As Lord Kṛṣṇa says, <em>mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram:</em> “This material nature is working under My direction.” When we see wonderful things happening in the cosmic nature, we should know that behind this cosmic manifestation there is a controller. Nothing could be manifested without being controlled. It is childish not to consider the controller. For instance, a child may think that an automobile is quite wonderful to be able to run without a horse or other animal pulling it, but a sane man knows the nature of the automobile’s engineering arrangement. He always knows that behind the machinery there is a man, a driver. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the driver under whose direction everything is working. Now the <em>jīvas,</em> or the living entities, have been accepted by the Lord, as we will note in the later chapters, as His parts and parcels. A particle of gold is also gold, a drop of water from the ocean is also salty, and similarly we the living entities, being part and parcel of the supreme controller, <em>īśvara,</em> or Bhagavān, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, have all the qualities of the Supreme Lord in minute quantity because we are minute <em>īśvaras,</em> subordinate <em>īśvaras.</em> We are trying to control nature, as presently we are trying to control space or planets, and this tendency to control is there because it is in Kṛṣṇa. But although we have a tendency to lord it over material nature, we should know that we are not the supreme controller. This is explained in <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em></div></div><div id="bb75" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">What is material nature? This is also explained in the <em>Gītā</em> as inferior <em>prakṛti,</em> inferior nature. The living entity is explained as the superior <em>prakṛti. Prakṛti</em> is always under control, whether inferior or superior. <em>Prakṛti</em> is female, and she is controlled by the Lord just as the activities of a wife are controlled by the husband. <em>Prakṛti</em> is always subordinate, predominated by the Lord, who is the predominator. The living entities and material nature are both predominated, controlled by the Supreme Lord. According to the <em>Gītā,</em> the living entities, although parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, are to be considered <em>prakṛti.</em> This is clearly mentioned in the Seventh Chapter of <em>Bhagavad-gītā. Apareyam itas tv anyāṁ prakṛtiṁ viddhi me parām/ jīva-bhūtām:</em> “This material nature is My inferior <em>prakṛti,</em> but beyond this is another <em>prakṛti – jīva-bhūtām,</em> the living entities.”</div></div><div id="bb76" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Material nature itself is constituted by three qualities: the mode of goodness, the mode of passion and the mode of ignorance. Above these modes there is eternal time, and by a combination of these modes of nature and under the control and purview of eternal time there are activities, which are called <em>karma.</em> These activities are being carried out from time immemorial, and we are suffering or enjoying the fruits of our activities. For instance, suppose I am a businessman and have worked very hard with intelligence and have amassed a great bank balance. Then I am an enjoyer. But then say I have lost all my money in business; then I am a sufferer. Similarly, in every field of life we enjoy the results of our work, or we suffer the results. This is called <em>karma.</em></div></div><div id="bb77" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify"><em>Īśvara</em> (the Supreme Lord), <em>jīva</em> (the living entity), <em>prakṛti</em> (nature), <em>kāla</em> (eternal time) and <em>karma</em> (activity) are all explained in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> Out of these five, the Lord, the living entities, material nature and time are eternal. The manifestation of <em>prakṛti</em> may be temporary, but it is not false. Some philosophers say that the manifestation of material nature is false, but according to the philosophy of <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> or according to the philosophy of the Vaiṣṇavas, this is not so. The manifestation of the world is not accepted as false; it is accepted as real, but temporary. It is likened unto a cloud which moves across the sky, or the coming of the rainy season, which nourishes grains. As soon as the rainy season is over and as soon as the cloud goes away, all the crops which were nourished by the rain dry up. Similarly, this material manifestation takes place at a certain interval, stays for a while and then disappears. Such are the workings of <em>prakṛti.</em> But this cycle is working eternally. Therefore <em>prakṛti</em> is eternal; it is not false. The Lord refers to this as “My <em>prakṛti.</em>” This material nature is the separated energy of the Supreme Lord, and similarly the living entities are also the energy of the Supreme Lord, although they are not separated but eternally related. So the Lord, the living entity, material nature and time are all interrelated and are all eternal. However, the other item, <em>karma,</em> is not eternal. The effects of <em>karma</em> may be very old indeed. We are suffering or enjoying the results of our activities from time immemorial, but we can change the results of our <em>karma,</em> or our activity, and this change depends on the perfection of our knowledge. We are engaged in various activities. Undoubtedly we do not know what sort of activities we should adopt to gain relief from the actions and reactions of all these activities, but this is also explained in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em></div></div><div id="bb78" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The position of <em>īśvara,</em> the Supreme Lord, is that of supreme consciousness. The <em>jīvas,</em> or the living entities, being parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, are also conscious. Both the living entity and material nature are explained as <em>prakṛti,</em> the energy of the Supreme Lord, but one of the two, the <em>jīva,</em> is conscious. The other <em>prakṛti</em> is not conscious. That is the difference. Therefore the <em>jīva-prakṛti</em> is called superior because the <em>jīva</em> has consciousness which is similar to the Lord’s. The Lord’s is supreme consciousness, however, and one should not claim that the <em>jīva,</em> the living entity, is also supremely conscious. The living being cannot be supremely conscious at any stage of his perfection, and the theory that he can be so is a misleading theory. Conscious he may be, but he is not perfectly or supremely conscious.</div></div><div id="bb79" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The distinction between the <em>jīva</em> and the <em>īśvara</em> will be explained in the Thirteenth Chapter of <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> The Lord is <em>kṣetra-jña,</em> conscious, as is the living being, but the living being is conscious of his particular body, whereas the Lord is conscious of all bodies. Because He lives in the heart of every living being, He is conscious of the psychic movements of the particular <em>jīvas.</em> We should not forget this. It is also explained that the Paramātmā, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is living in everyone’s heart as <em>īśvara,</em> as the controller, and that He is giving directions for the living entity to act as he desires. The living entity forgets what to do. First of all he makes a determination to act in a certain way, and then he is entangled in the actions and reactions of his own <em>karma.</em> After giving up one type of body, he enters another type of body, as we take off and put on clothes. As the soul thus migrates, he suffers the actions and reactions of his past activities. These activities can be changed when the living being is in the mode of goodness, in sanity, and understands what sort of activities he should adopt. If he does so, then all the actions and reactions of his past activities can be changed. Consequently, <em>karma</em> is not eternal. Therefore we stated that of the five items (<em>īśvara, jīva, prakṛti,</em> time and <em>karma</em>) four are eternal, whereas <em>karma</em> is not eternal.</div></div><div id="bb80" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The supreme conscious <em>īśvara</em> is similar to the living entity in this way: both the consciousness of the Lord and that of the living entity are transcendental. It is not that consciousness is generated by the association of matter. That is a mistaken idea. The theory that consciousness develops under certain circumstances of material combination is not accepted in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> Consciousness may be pervertedly reflected by the covering of material circumstances, just as light reflected through colored glass may appear to be a certain color, but the consciousness of the Lord is not materially affected. Lord Kṛṣṇa says, <em>mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ.</em> When He descends into the material universe, His consciousness is not materially affected. If He were so affected, He would be unfit to speak on transcendental matters as He does in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> One cannot say anything about the transcendental world without being free from materially contaminated consciousness. So the Lord is not materially contaminated. Our consciousness, at the present moment, however, <em>is</em> materially contaminated. The <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> teaches that we have to purify this materially contaminated consciousness. In pure consciousness, our actions will be dovetailed to the will of the <em>īśvara,</em> and that will make us happy. It is not that we have to cease all activities. Rather, our activities are to be purified, and purified activities are called <em>bhakti.</em> Activities in <em>bhakti</em> appear to be like ordinary activities, but they are not contaminated. An ignorant person may see that a devotee is acting or working like an ordinary man, but such a person with a poor fund of knowledge does not know that the activities of the devotee or of the Lord are not contaminated by impure consciousness or matter. They are transcendental to the three modes of nature. We should know, however, that at this point our consciousness is contaminated.</div></div><div id="bb81" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">When we are materially contaminated, we are called conditioned. False consciousness is exhibited under the impression that I am a product of material nature. This is called false ego. One who is absorbed in the thought of bodily conceptions cannot understand his situation. <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> was spoken to liberate one from the bodily conception of life, and Arjuna put himself in this position in order to receive this information from the Lord. One must become free from the bodily conception of life; that is the preliminary activity for the transcendentalist. One who wants to become free, who wants to become liberated, must first of all learn that he is not this material body. <em>Mukti,</em> or liberation, means freedom from material consciousness. In the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> also the definition of liberation is given. <em>Muktir hitvānyathā-rūpaṁ svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ: mukti</em> means liberation from the contaminated consciousness of this material world and situation in pure consciousness. All the instructions of <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> are intended to awaken this pure consciousness, and therefore we find at the last stage of the <em>Gītā’s</em> instructions that Kṛṣṇa is asking Arjuna whether he is now in purified consciousness. Purified consciousness means acting in accordance with the instructions of the Lord. This is the whole sum and substance of purified consciousness. Consciousness is already there because we are part and parcel of the Lord, but for us there is the affinity of being affected by the inferior modes. But the Lord, being the Supreme, is never affected. That is the difference between the Supreme Lord and the small individual souls.</div></div><div id="bb82" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">What is this consciousness? This consciousness is “I am.” Then what am I? In contaminated consciousness “I am” means “I am the lord of all I survey. I am the enjoyer.” The world revolves because every living being thinks that he is the lord and creator of the material world. Material consciousness has two psychic divisions. One is that I am the creator, and the other is that I am the enjoyer. But actually the Supreme Lord is both the creator and the enjoyer, and the living entity, being part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is neither the creator nor the enjoyer, but a cooperator. He is the created and the enjoyed. For instance, a part of a machine cooperates with the whole machine; a part of the body cooperates with the whole body. The hands, legs, eyes and so on are all parts of the body, but they are not actually the enjoyers. The stomach is the enjoyer. The legs move, the hands supply food, the teeth chew, and all parts of the body are engaged in satisfying the stomach because the stomach is the principal factor that nourishes the body’s organization. Therefore everything is given to the stomach. One nourishes the tree by watering its root, and one nourishes the body by feeding the stomach, for if the body is to be kept in a healthy state, then the parts of the body must cooperate to feed the stomach. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the enjoyer and the creator, and we, as subordinate living beings, are meant to cooperate to satisfy Him. This cooperation will actually help us, just as food taken by the stomach will help all other parts of the body. If the fingers of the hand think that they should take the food themselves instead of giving it to the stomach, then they will be frustrated. The central figure of creation and of enjoyment is the Supreme Lord, and the living entities are cooperators. By cooperation they enjoy. The relation is also like that of the master and the servant. If the master is fully satisfied, then the servant is satisfied. Similarly, the Supreme Lord should be satisfied, although the tendency to become the creator and the tendency to enjoy the material world are there also in the living entities because these tendencies are there in the Supreme Lord who has created the manifested cosmic world.</div></div><div id="bb83" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">We shall find, therefore, in this <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> that the complete whole is comprised of the supreme controller, the controlled living entities, the cosmic manifestation, eternal time and <em>karma,</em> or activities, and all of these are explained in this text. All of these taken completely form the complete whole, and the complete whole is called the Supreme Absolute Truth. The complete whole and the complete Absolute Truth are the complete Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. All manifestations are due to His different energies.

Brahman is more explicitly explained in the <em>Brahma-sūtra</em> to be like the rays of the sunshine. The impersonal Brahman is the shining rays of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Impersonal Brahman is incomplete realization of the absolute whole, and so also is the conception of Paramātmā. In the Fifteenth Chapter it shall be seen that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Puruṣottama, is above both impersonal Brahman and the partial realization of Paramātmā. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is called <em>sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha.</em> The <em>Brahma-saṁhitā</em> begins in this way: <em>īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ/ anādir ādir govindaḥ sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam.</em> “Govinda, Kṛṣṇa, is the cause of all causes. He is the primal cause, and He is the very form of eternity, knowledge and bliss.” Impersonal Brahman realization is the realization of His <em>sat</em> (eternity) feature. Paramātmā realization is the realization of <em>sat-cit</em> (eternal knowledge). But realization of the Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, is realization of all the transcendental features: <em>sat, cit</em> and <em>ānanda</em> (eternity, knowledge and bliss) in complete <em>vigraha</em> (form).</div></div><div id="bb85" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">People with less intelligence consider the Supreme Truth to be impersonal, but He is a transcendental person, and this is confirmed in all Vedic literatures. <em>Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām</em> (<em>Kaṭha Upaniṣad</em> 2.2.13). As we are all individual living beings and have our individuality, the Supreme Absolute Truth is also, in the ultimate issue, a person, and realization of the Personality of Godhead is realization of all of the transcendental features in His complete form. The complete whole is not formless. If He is formless, or if He is less than any other thing, then He cannot be the complete whole. The complete whole must have everything within our experience and beyond our experience, otherwise it cannot be complete.</div></div><div id="bb86" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The complete whole, the Personality of Godhead, has immense potencies (<em>parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate</em>). How Kṛṣṇa is acting in different potencies is also explained in <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> This phenomenal world or material world in which we are placed is also complete in itself because the twenty-four elements of which this material universe is a temporary manifestation, according to Sāṅkhya philosophy, are completely adjusted to produce complete resources which are necessary for the maintenance and subsistence of this universe. There is nothing extraneous, nor is there anything needed. This manifestation has its own time fixed by the energy of the supreme whole, and when its time is complete, these temporary manifestations will be annihilated by the complete arrangement of the complete. There is complete facility for the small complete units, namely the living entities, to realize the complete, and all sorts of incompleteness are experienced due to incomplete knowledge of the complete. So <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> contains the complete knowledge of Vedic wisdom.</div></div><div id="bb87" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">All Vedic knowledge is infallible, and Hindus accept Vedic knowledge to be complete and infallible. For example, cow dung is the stool of an animal, and according to <em>smṛti,</em> or Vedic injunction, if one touches the stool of an animal he has to take a bath to purify himself. But in the Vedic scriptures cow dung is considered to be a purifying agent. One might consider this to be contradictory, but it is accepted because it is Vedic injunction, and indeed by accepting this, one will not commit a mistake; subsequently it has been proved by modern science that cow dung contains all antiseptic properties. So Vedic knowledge is complete because it is above all doubts and mistakes, and <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> is the essence of all Vedic knowledge.</div></div><div id="bb88" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Vedic knowledge is not a question of research. Our research work is imperfect because we are researching things with imperfect senses. We have to accept perfect knowledge which comes down, as is stated in <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> by the <em>paramparā</em> (disciplic succession). We have to receive knowledge from the proper source in disciplic succession beginning with the supreme spiritual master, the Lord Himself, and handed down to a succession of spiritual masters. Arjuna, the student who took lessons from Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, accepts everything that He says without contradicting Him. One is not allowed to accept one portion of <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> and not another. No. We must accept <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> without interpretation, without deletion and without our own whimsical participation in the matter. The <em>Gītā</em> should be taken as the most perfect presentation of Vedic knowledge. Vedic knowledge is received from transcendental sources, and the first words were spoken by the Lord Himself. The words spoken by the Lord are called <em>apauruṣeya,</em> meaning that they are different from words spoken by a person of the mundane world who is infected with four defects. A mundaner (1) is sure to commit mistakes, (2) is invariably illusioned, (3) has the tendency to cheat others and (4) is limited by imperfect senses. With these four imperfections, one cannot deliver perfect information of all-pervading knowledge.</div></div><div id="bb89" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Vedic knowledge is not imparted by such defective living entities. It was imparted unto the heart of Brahmā, the first created living being, and Brahmā in his turn disseminated this knowledge to his sons and disciples, as he originally received it from the Lord. The Lord is <em>pūrṇam,</em> all-perfect, and there is no possibility of His becoming subjected to the laws of material nature. One should therefore be intelligent enough to know that the Lord is the only proprietor of everything in the universe and that He is the original creator, the creator of Brahmā. In the Eleventh Chapter the Lord is addressed as <em>prapitāmaha</em> because Brahmā is addressed as <em>pitāmaha,</em> the grandfather, and He is the creator of the grandfather. So no one should claim to be the proprietor of anything; one should accept only things set aside for him by the Lord as his quota for his maintenance.</div></div><div id="bb90" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">There are many examples given of how we are to utilize those things which are set aside for us by the Lord. This is also explained in <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> In the beginning, Arjuna decided that he should not fight in the Battle of Kurukṣetra. This was his own decision. Arjuna told the Lord that it was not possible for him to enjoy the kingdom after killing his own kinsmen. This decision was based on the body because he was thinking that the body was himself and that his bodily relations or expansions were his brothers, nephews, brothers-in-law, grandfathers and so on. Therefore he wanted to satisfy his bodily demands. <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> was spoken by the Lord just to change this view, and at the end Arjuna decides to fight under the directions of the Lord when he says, <em>kariṣye vacanaṁ tava:</em> “I shall act according to Your word.”</div></div><div id="bb91" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In this world men are not meant for quarreling like cats and dogs. Men must be intelligent to realize the importance of human life and refuse to act like ordinary animals. A human being should realize the aim of his life, and this direction is given in all Vedic literatures, and the essence is given in <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> Vedic literature is meant for human beings, not for animals. Animals can kill other living animals, and there is no question of sin on their part, but if a man kills an animal for the satisfaction of his uncontrolled taste, he must be responsible for breaking the laws of nature. In the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> it is clearly explained that there are three kinds of activities according to the different modes of nature: the activities of goodness, of passion and of ignorance. Similarly, there are three kinds of eatables also: eatables in goodness, passion and ignorance. All of this is clearly described, and if we properly utilize the instructions of <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> then our whole life will become purified, and ultimately we will be able to reach the destination which is beyond this material sky.</div></div><div id="bb92" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">That destination is called the <em>sanātana</em> sky, the eternal, spiritual sky (<em>yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama</em>). In this material world we find that everything is temporary. It comes into being, stays for some time, produces some by-products, dwindles and then vanishes. That is the law of the material world, whether we use as an example this body, or a piece of fruit or anything. But beyond this temporary world there is another world of which we have information. That world consists of another nature, which is <em>sanātana,</em> eternal. The <em>jīva</em> is also described as <em>sanātana,</em> eternal, and the Lord is also described as <em>sanātana</em> in the Eleventh Chapter. We have an intimate relationship with the Lord, and because we are all qualitatively one – the <em>sanātana-dhāma,</em> or sky, the <em>sanātana</em> Supreme Personality and the <em>sanātana</em> living entities – the whole purpose of <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> is to revive our <em>sanātana</em> occupation, or <em>sanātana-dharma,</em> which is the eternal occupation of the living entity. We are temporarily engaged in different activities, but all of these activities can be purified when we give up all these temporary activities and take up the activities which are prescribed by the Supreme Lord. That is called our pure life.</div></div><div id="bb93" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The Supreme Lord and His transcendental abode are both <em>sanātana,</em> as are the living entities, and the combined association of the Supreme Lord and the living entities in the <em>sanātana</em> abode is the perfection of human life. The Lord is very kind to the living entities because they are His sons. Lord Kṛṣṇa declares in <em>Bhagavad-gītā, sarva-yoniṣu … ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā:</em> “I am the father of all.” Of course there are all types of living entities according to their various <em>karmas,</em> but here the Lord claims that He is the father of all of them. Therefore the Lord descends to reclaim all of these fallen, conditioned souls, to call them back to the <em>sanātana</em> eternal sky so that the <em>sanātana</em> living entities may regain their eternal <em>sanātana</em> positions in eternal association with the Lord. The Lord comes Himself in different incarnations, or He sends His confidential servants as sons or His associates or <em>ācāryas</em> to reclaim the conditioned souls.</div></div><div id="bb94" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Therefore, <em>sanātana-dharma</em> does not refer to any sectarian process of religion. It is the eternal function of the eternal living entities in relationship with the eternal Supreme Lord. <em>Sanātana-dharma</em> refers, as stated previously, to the eternal occupation of the living entity. Śrīpāda Rāmānujācārya has explained the word <em>sanātana</em> as “that which has neither beginning nor end,” so when we speak of <em>sanātana-dharma,</em> we must take it for granted on the authority of Śrīpāda Rāmānujācārya that it has neither beginning nor end.</div></div><div id="bb95" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The English word <em>religion</em> is a little different from <em>sanātana-dharma. Religion</em> conveys the idea of faith, and faith may change. One may have faith in a particular process, and he may change this faith and adopt another, but <em>sanātana-dharma</em> refers to that activity which cannot be changed. For instance, liquidity cannot be taken from water, nor can heat be taken from fire. Similarly, the eternal function of the eternal living entity cannot be taken from the living entity. <em>Sanātana-dharma</em> is eternally integral with the living entity. When we speak of <em>sanātana-dharma,</em> therefore, we must take it for granted on the authority of Śrīpāda Rāmānujācārya that it has neither beginning nor end. That which has neither end nor beginning must not be sectarian, for it cannot be limited by any boundaries. Those belonging to some sectarian faith will wrongly consider that <em>sanātana-dharma</em> is also sectarian, but if we go deeply into the matter and consider it in the light of modern science, it is possible for us to see that <em>sanātana-dharma</em> is the business of all the people of the world – nay, of all the living entities of the universe.</div></div><div id="bb96" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Non-<em>sanātana</em> religious faith may have some beginning in the annals of human history, but there is no beginning to the history of <em>sanātana-dharma,</em> because it remains eternally with the living entities. Insofar as the living entities are concerned, the authoritative <em>śāstras</em> state that the living entity has neither birth nor death. In the <em>Gītā</em> it is stated that the living entity is never born and he never dies. He is eternal and indestructible, and he continues to live after the destruction of his temporary material body. In reference to the concept of <em>sanātana-dharma,</em> we must try to understand the concept of religion from the Sanskrit root meaning of the word. <em>Dharma</em> refers to that which is constantly existing with a particular object. We conclude that there is heat and light along with the fire; without heat and light, there is no meaning to the word fire. Similarly, we must discover the essential part of the living being, that part which is his constant companion. That constant companion is his eternal quality, and that eternal quality is his eternal religion.</div></div><div id="bb97" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">When Sanātana Gosvāmī asked Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu about the <em>svarūpa</em> of every living being, the Lord replied that the <em>svarūpa,</em> or constitutional position, of the living being is the rendering of service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If we analyze this statement of Lord Caitanya’s, we can easily see that every living being is constantly engaged in rendering service to another living being. A living being serves other living beings in various capacities. By doing so, the living entity enjoys life. The lower animals serve human beings as servants serve their master. A serves B master, B serves C master, and C serves D master and so on. Under these circumstances, we can see that one friend serves another friend, the mother serves the son, the wife serves the husband, the husband serves the wife and so on. If we go on searching in this spirit, it will be seen that there is no exception in the society of living beings to the activity of service. The politician presents his manifesto for the public to convince them of his capacity for service. The voters therefore give the politician their valuable votes, thinking that he will render valuable service to society. The shopkeeper serves the customer, and the artisan serves the capitalist. The capitalist serves the family, and the family serves the state in the terms of the eternal capacity of the eternal living being. In this way we can see that no living being is exempt from rendering service to other living beings, and therefore we can safely conclude that service is the constant companion of the living being and that the rendering of service is the eternal religion of the living being.</div></div><div id="bb98" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Yet man professes to belong to a particular type of faith with reference to particular time and circumstance and thus claims to be a Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist or an adherent of any other sect.

But in all circumstances the change of religious faith does not affect the eternal occupation of rendering service to others. The Hindu, Muslim or Christian in all circumstances is a servant of someone.

No planet in the material universe is free from these four principles of material existence.</div></div><div id="bb109" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The living entities are traveling from one planet to another, but it is not that we can go to any planet we like merely by a mechanical arrangement.

The <em>Gītā</em> instructs: <em>yānti deva-vratā devān.</em> The moon, the sun and higher planets are called Svargaloka. There are three different statuses of planets: higher, middle and lower planetary systems. The earth belongs to the middle planetary system. <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> informs us how to travel to the higher planetary systems (Devaloka) with a very simple formula: <em>yānti deva-vratā devān.</em> One need only worship the particular demigod of that particular planet and in that way go to the moon, the sun or any of the higher planetary systems.</div></div><div id="bb110" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">Yet <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> does not advise us to go to any of the planets in this material world, because even if we go to Brahmaloka, the highest planet, through some sort of mechanical contrivance by maybe traveling for forty thousand years (and who would live that long?), we will still find the material inconveniences of birth, death, disease and old age. But one who wants to approach the supreme planet, Kṛṣṇaloka, or any other planet within the spiritual sky, will not meet with these material inconveniences. Amongst all of the planets in the spiritual sky there is one supreme planet called Goloka Vṛndāvana, the original planet in the abode of the original Personality of Godhead Śrī Kṛṣṇa. All of this information is given in <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> and we are given through its instruction information how to leave the material world and begin a truly blissful life in the spiritual sky.</div></div><div id="bb111" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In the Fifteenth Chapter of the <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> the real picture of the material world is given.

In the shadow there is no reality or substantiality, but from the shadow we can understand that there are substance and reality.

In the Vedic literature we can receive much information about all the planets, and we can believe it or not believe it. All of the important planets are described in the Vedic literatures, especially <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</em> and the spiritual world, which is beyond this material sky, is described as <em>avyakta,</em> unmanifested.

Of this there is no doubt.” (<a href="/en/library/bg/8/5/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline">Bg. 8.5</a>) One who thinks of Kṛṣṇa at the time of his death goes to Kṛṣṇa. One must remember the form of Kṛṣṇa; if he quits his body thinking of this form, he surely approaches the spiritual kingdom. <em>Mad-bhāvam</em> refers to the supreme nature of the Supreme Being. The Supreme Being is <em>sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha</em> – that is, His form is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. Our present body is not <em>sac-cid-ānanda.</em> It is <em>asat,</em> not <em>sat.</em> It is not eternal; it is perishable. It is not <em>cit,</em> full of knowledge, but it is full of ignorance. We have no knowledge of the spiritual kingdom, nor do we even have perfect knowledge of this material world, where there are so many things unknown to us. The body is also <em>nirānanda;</em> instead of being full of bliss it is full of misery. All of the miseries we experience in the material world arise from the body, but one who leaves this body thinking of Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, at once attains a <em>sac-cid-ānanda</em> body.</div></div><div id="bb123" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The process of quitting this body and getting another body in the material world is also organized. A man dies after it has been decided what form of body he will have in the next life. Higher authorities, not the living entity himself, make this decision. According to our activities in this life, we either rise or sink. This life is a preparation for the next life. If we can prepare, therefore, in this life to get promotion to the kingdom of God, then surely, after quitting this material body, we will attain a spiritual body just like the Lord’s.</div></div><div id="bb124" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">As explained before, there are different kinds of transcendentalists – the <em>brahma-vādī, paramātma-vādī</em> and the devotee – and, as mentioned, in the <em>brahma-jyotir</em> (spiritual sky) there are innumerable spiritual planets. The number of these planets is far, far greater than all of the planets of this material world. This material world has been approximated as only one quarter of the creation (<em>ekāṁśena sthito jagat</em>). In this material segment there are millions and billions of universes with trillions of planets and suns, stars and moons. But this whole material creation is only a fragment of the total creation. Most of the creation is in the spiritual sky. One who desires to merge into the existence of the Supreme Brahman is at once transferred to the <em>brahma-jyotir</em> of the Supreme Lord and thus attains the spiritual sky. The devotee, who wants to enjoy the association of the Lord, enters into the Vaikuṇṭha planets, which are innumerable, and the Supreme Lord by His plenary expansions as Nārāyaṇa with four hands and with different names like Pradyumna, Aniruddha and Govinda associates with him there. Therefore at the end of life the transcendentalists think either of the <em>brahma-jyotir,</em> the Paramātmā or the Supreme Personality of Godhead Śrī Kṛṣṇa. In all cases they enter into the spiritual sky, but only the devotee, or he who is in personal touch with the Supreme Lord, enters into the Vaikuṇṭha planets or the Goloka Vṛndāvana planet. The Lord further adds that of this “there is no doubt.” This must be believed firmly. We should not reject that which does not tally with our imagination; our attitude should be that of Arjuna: “I believe everything that You have said.” Therefore when the Lord says that at the time of death whoever thinks of Him as Brahman or Paramātmā or as the Personality of Godhead certainly enters into the spiritual sky, there is no doubt about it. There is no question of disbelieving it.</div></div><div id="bb125" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The <a href="/en/library/bg/8/6/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (8.6)</a> also explains the general principle that makes it possible to enter the spiritual kingdom simply by thinking of the Supreme at the time of death:</div></div><div id="bb126" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic">yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran bhāvaṁ<br />tyajaty ante kalevaram<br />taṁ tam evaiti kaunteya<br />sadā tad-bhāva-bhāvitaḥ</div></div><div id="bb127" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">“Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his present body, in his next life he will attain to that state without fail.” Now, first we must understand that material nature is a display of one of the energies of the Supreme Lord. In the <em>Viṣṇu Purāṇa</em> (6.7.61) the total energies of the Supreme Lord are delineated:</div></div><div id="bb128" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic">viṣṇu-śaktiḥ parā proktā<br />kṣetra-jñākhyā tathā parā<br />avidyā-karma-saṁjñānyā<br />tṛtīyā śaktir iṣyate</div></div><div id="bb129" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The Supreme Lord has diverse and innumerable energies which are beyond our conception; however, great learned sages or liberated souls have studied these energies and have analyzed them into three parts. All of the energies are of <em>viṣṇu-śakti,</em> that is to say they are different potencies of Lord Viṣṇu. The first energy is <em>parā,</em> transcendental. Living entities also belong to the superior energy, as has already been explained. The other energies, or material energies, are in the mode of ignorance. At the time of death either we can remain in the inferior energy of this material world, or we can transfer to the energy of the spiritual world. So the <a href="/en/library/bg/8/6/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (8.6)</a> says:</div></div><div id="bb130" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic">yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran bhāvaṁ<br />tyajaty ante kalevaram<br />taṁ tam evaiti kaunteya<br />sadā tad-bhāva-bhāvitaḥ</div></div><div id="bb131" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">“Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his present body, in his next life he will attain to that state without fail.”</div></div><div id="bb132" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">In life we are accustomed to thinking either of the material or of the spiritual energy. Now, how can we transfer our thoughts from the material energy to the spiritual energy? There are so many literatures which fill our thoughts with the material energy – newspapers, magazines, novels, etc. Our thinking, which is now absorbed in these literatures, must be transferred to the Vedic literatures. The great sages, therefore, have written so many Vedic literatures, such as the <em>Purāṇas.</em> The <em>Purāṇas</em> are not imaginative; they are historical records. In the <a href="/en/library/cc/madhya/20/122/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline"><em>Caitanya-caritāmṛta</em> (<em>Madhya</em> 20.122)</a> there is the following verse:</div></div><div id="bb133" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic">māyā-mugdha jīvera nāhi svataḥ kṛṣṇa-jñāna<br />jīvere kṛpāya kailā kṛṣṇa veda-purāṇa</div></div><div id="bb134" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">The forgetful living entities or conditioned souls have forgotten their relationship with the Supreme Lord, and they are engrossed in thinking of material activities. Just to transfer their thinking power to the spiritual sky, Kṛṣṇa-dvaipāyana Vyāsa has given a great number of Vedic literatures. First he divided the <em>Vedas</em> into four, then he explained them in the <em>Purāṇas,</em> and for less capable people he wrote the <em>Mahābhārata.</em> In the <em>Mahābhārata</em> there is given the <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> Then all Vedic literature is summarized in the <em>Vedānta-sūtra,</em> and for future guidance he gave a natural commentation on the <em>Vedānta-sūtra,</em> called <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</em> We must always engage our minds in reading these Vedic literatures. Just as materialists engage their minds in reading newspapers, magazines and so many materialistic literatures, we must transfer our reading to these literatures which are given to us by Vyāsadeva; in that way it will be possible for us to remember the Supreme Lord at the time of death. That is the only way suggested by the Lord, and He guarantees the result: “There is no doubt.”</div></div><div id="bb135" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic">tasmāt sarveṣu kāleṣu<br />mām anusmara yudhya ca<br />mayy arpita-mano-buddhir<br />mām evaiṣyasy asaṁśayaḥ</div></div><div id="bb136" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">“Therefore, Arjuna, you should always think of Me in the form of Kṛṣṇa and at the same time continue your prescribed duty of fighting.

No, the Lord never suggests anything impractical. In this material world, in order to maintain the body one has to work. Human society is divided, according to work, into four divisions of social order – <em>brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya</em> and <em>śūdra.</em> The <em>brāhmaṇa</em> class or intelligent class is working in one way, the <em>kṣatriya</em> or administrative class is working in another way, and the mercantile class and the laborers are all tending to their specific duties. In the human society, whether one is a laborer, merchant, administrator or farmer, or even if one belongs to the highest class and is a literary man, a scientist or a theologian, he has to work in order to maintain his existence. The Lord therefore tells Arjuna that he need not give up his occupation, but while he is engaged in his occupation he should remember Kṛṣṇa (<em>mām anusmara</em>). If he doesn’t practice remembering Kṛṣṇa while he is struggling for existence, then it will not be possible for him to remember Kṛṣṇa at the time of death. Lord Caitanya also advises this. He says, <em>kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ:</em> one should practice chanting the names of the Lord always. The names of the Lord and the Lord are nondifferent. So Lord Kṛṣṇa’s instructions to Arjuna to “remember Me” and Lord Caitanya’s injunction to “always chant the names of Lord Kṛṣṇa” are the same instruction. There is no difference, because Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa’s name are nondifferent. In the absolute status there is no difference between reference and referrent. Therefore we have to practice remembering the Lord always, twenty-four hours a day, by chanting His names and molding our life’s activities in such a way that we can remember Him always.</div></div><div id="bb138" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">How is this possible? The <em>ācāryas</em> give the following example. If a married woman is attached to another man, or if a man has an attachment for a woman other than his wife, then the attachment is to be considered very strong. One with such an attachment is always thinking of the loved one. The wife who is thinking of her lover is always thinking of meeting him, even while she is carrying out her household chores. In fact, she carries out her household work even more carefully so her husband will not suspect her attachment. Similarly, we should always remember the supreme lover, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and at the same time perform our material duties very nicely. A strong sense of love is required here. If we have a strong sense of love for the Supreme Lord, then we can discharge our duty and at the same time remember Him. But we have to develop that sense of love. Arjuna, for instance, was always thinking of Kṛṣṇa; he was the constant companion of Kṛṣṇa, and at the same time he was a warrior. Kṛṣṇa did not advise him to give up fighting and go to the forest to meditate. When Lord Kṛṣṇa delineates the <em>yoga</em> system to Arjuna, Arjuna says that the practice of this system is not possible for him.</div></div><div id="bb139" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic">arjuna uvāca</div></div><div id="bb140" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic">yo ’yaṁ yogas tvayā proktaḥ<br />sāmyena madhusūdana<br />etasyāhaṁ na paśyāmi<br />cañcalatvāt sthitiṁ sthirām</div></div><div id="bb141" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">“Arjuna said: O Madhusūdana, the system of <em>yoga</em> which You have summarized appears impractical and unendurable to me, for the mind is restless and unsteady.” (<a href="/en/library/bg/6/33/" class="text-vb-link hover:underline">Bg. 6.33</a>)</div></div><div id="bb142" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">But the Lord says:</div></div><div id="bb143" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base text-center italic">yoginām api sarveṣāṁ<br />mad-gatenāntar-ātmanā<br />śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ<br />sa me yukta-tamo mataḥ</div></div><div id="bb144" class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify copy user-select-text"><div class="em:mb-4 em:leading-8 em:text-base s-justify">“Of all <em>yogīs,</em> the one with great faith who always abides in Me, thinks of Me within himself, and renders transcendental loving service to Me is the most intimately united with Me in <em>yoga</em> and is the highest of all.

The Lord further tells Arjuna that as a <em>kṣatriya</em> he cannot give up his fighting, but if Arjuna fights remembering Kṛṣṇa, then he will be able to remember Kṛṣṇa at the time of death.

The <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> teaches one how to absorb the mind and intelligence in the thought of the Lord. Such absorption will enable one to transfer himself to the kingdom of the Lord.

The speaker of \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e is Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. He is mentioned on every page of \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagavān. Of course the word \u003cem\u003ebhagavān\u003c/em\u003e sometimes refers to any powerful person or any powerful demigod, and certainly here \u003cem\u003ebhagavān\u003c/em\u003e designates Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa as a great personality, but at the same time we should know that Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as is confirmed by all great \u003cem\u003eācāryas\u003c/em\u003e (spiritual masters) like Śaṅkarācārya, Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Nimbārka Svāmī, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and many other authorities of Vedic knowledge in India. The Lord Himself also establishes Himself as the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā,\u003c/em\u003e and He is accepted as such in the \u003cem\u003eBrahma-saṁhitā\u003c/em\u003e and all the \u003cem\u003ePurāṇas,\u003c/em\u003e especially the \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,\u003c/em\u003e known as the \u003cem\u003eBhāgavata Purāṇa\u003c/em\u003e (\u003cem\u003ekṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam\u003c/em\u003e). Therefore we should take \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e as it is directed by the Personality of Godhead Himself. In the Fourth Chapter of the \u003ca href=\"/en/library/bg/4/1/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eGītā\u003c/em\u003e (4.1–3)\u003c/a\u003e the Lord says:\u003c/p\u003e2e:T5e9,He tells Arjuna that He is relating this supreme secret to him because Arjuna is His devotee and His friend. The purport of this is that \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e is a treatise which is especially meant for the devotee of the Lord. There are three classes of transcendentalists, namely the \u003cem\u003ejñānī,\u003c/em\u003e the \u003cem\u003eyogī\u003c/em\u003e and the \u003cem\u003ebhakta,\u003c/em\u003e or the impersonalist, the meditator and the devotee. Here the Lord clearly tells Arjuna that He is making him the first receiver of a new \u003cem\u003eparamparā\u003c/em\u003e (disciplic succession) because the old succession was broken. It was the Lord’s wish, therefore, to establish another \u003cem\u003eparamparā\u003c/em\u003e in the same line of thought that was coming down from the sun-god to others, and it was His wish that "])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"His teaching be distributed anew by Arjuna. He wanted Arjuna to become the authority in understanding the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā.\u003c/em\u003e So we see that \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e is instructed to Arjuna especially because Arjuna was a devotee of the Lord, a direct student of Kṛṣṇa, and His intimate friend. Therefore \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e is best understood by a person who has qualities similar to Arjuna’s. That is to say he must be a devotee in a direct relationship with the Lord. As soon as one becomes a devotee of the Lord, he also has a direct relationship with the Lord. That is a very elaborate subject matter, but briefly it can be stated that a devotee is in a relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in one of five different ways:2f:T4c2,The subject of the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e entails the comprehension of five basic truths. First of all the science of God is explained, and then the constitutional position of the living entities, \u003cem\u003ejīvas.\u003c/em\u003e There is \u003cem\u003eīśvara,\u003c/em\u003e which means the controller, and there are \u003cem\u003ejīvas,\u003c/em\u003e the living entities which are controlled. If a living entity says that he is not controlled but that he is free, then he is insane. The living being is controlled in every respect, at least in his conditioned life.

The cosmic manifestation is full of different activities. All living entities are engaged in different activities. From \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e we must learn what God is, what the living entities are, what \u003cem\u003eprakṛti\u003c/em\u003e is, what the cosmic manifestation is, how it is controlled by time, and what the activities of the living entities are.30:T859,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Out of these five basic subject matters in \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e it is established that the Supreme Godhead, or Kṛṣṇa, or Brahman, or the supreme controller, or Paramātmā – you may use whatever name you like – is the greatest of all. The living beings are in quality like the supreme controller. For instance, the Lord has control over the universal affairs of material nature, as will be explained in the later chapters of \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā.\u003c/em\u003e Material nature is not independent. She is acting under the directions of the Supreme Lord. As Lord Kṛṣṇa says, \u003cem\u003emayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram:\u003c/em\u003e “This material nature is working under My direction.” When we see wonderful things happening in the cosmic nature, we should know that behind this cosmic manifestation there is a controller. Nothing could be manifested without being controlled. It is childish not to consider the controller. For instance, a child may think that an automobile is quite wonderful to be able to run without a horse or other animal pulling it, but a sane man knows the nature of the automobile’s engineering arrangement. He always knows that behind the machinery there is a man, a driver. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the driver under whose direction everything is working. Now the \u003cem\u003ejīvas,\u003c/em\u003e or the living entities, have been accepted by the Lord, as we will note in the later chapters, as His parts and parcels. A particle of gold is also gold, a drop of water from the ocean is also salty, and similarly we the living entities, being part and parcel of the supreme controller, \u003cem\u003eīśvara,\u003c/em\u003e or Bhagavān, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, have all the qualities of the Supreme Lord in minute quantity because we are minute \u003cem\u003eīśvaras,\u003c/em\u003e subordinate \u003cem\u003eīśvaras.\u003c/em\u003e We are trying to control nature, as presently we are trying to control space or planets, and this tendency to control is there because it is in Kṛṣṇa. But although we have a tendency to lord it over material nature, we should know that we are not the supreme controller.

The manifestation of \u003cem\u003eprakṛti\u003c/em\u003e may be temporary, but it is not false. Some philosophers say that the manifestation of material nature is false, but according to the philosophy of \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e or according to the philosophy of the Vaiṣṇavas, this is not so. The manifestation of the world is not accepted as false; it is accepted as real, but temporary. It is likened unto a cloud which moves across the sky, or the coming of the rainy season, which nourishes grains. As soon as the rainy season is over and as soon as the cloud goes away, all the crops which were nourished by the rain dry up. Similarly, this material manifestation takes place at a certain interval, stays for a while and then disappears. Such are the workings of \u003cem\u003eprakṛti.\u003c/em\u003e But this cycle is working eternally. Therefore \u003cem\u003eprakṛti\u003c/em\u003e is eternal; it is not false. The Lord refers to this as “My \u003cem\u003eprakṛti.\u003c/em\u003e” This material nature is the separated energy of the Supreme Lord, and similarly the living entities are also the energy of the Supreme Lord, although they are not separated but eternally related. So the Lord, the living entity, material nature and time are all interrelated and are all eternal. However, the other item, \u003cem\u003ekarma,\u003c/em\u003e is not eternal. The effects of \u003cem\u003ekarma\u003c/em\u003e may be very old indeed. We are suffering or enjoying the results of our activities from time immemorial, but we can change the results of our \u003cem\u003ekarma,\u003c/em\u003e or our activity, and this change depends on the perfection of our knowledge. We are engaged in various activities. Undoubtedly we do not know what sort of activities we should adopt to gain relief from the actions and reactions of all these activities, but this is also explained in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā.\u003c/em\u003e"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"32:T5ee,The distinction between the \u003cem\u003ejīva\u003c/em\u003e and the \u003cem\u003eīśvara\u003c/em\u003e will be explained in the Thirteenth Chapter of \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā.\u003c/em\u003e The Lord is \u003cem\u003ekṣetra-jña,\u003c/em\u003e conscious, as is the living being, but the living being is conscious of his particular body, whereas the Lord is conscious of all bodies. Because He lives in the heart of every living being, He is conscious of the psychic movements of the particular \u003cem\u003ejīvas.\u003c/em\u003e We should not forget this. It is also explained that the Paramātmā, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is living in everyone’s heart as \u003cem\u003eīśvara,\u003c/em\u003e as the controller, and that He is giving directions for the living entity to act as he desires. The living entity forgets what to do. First of all he makes a determination to act in a certain way, and then he is entangled in the actions and reactions of his own \u003cem\u003ekarma.\u003c/em\u003e After giving up one type of body, he enters another type of body, as we take off and put on clothes. As the soul thus migrates, he suffers the actions and reactions of his past activities. These activities can be changed when the living being is in the mode of goodness, in sanity, and understands what sort of activities he should adopt. If he does so, then all the actions and reactions of his past activities can be changed. Consequently, \u003cem\u003ekarma\u003c/em\u003e is not eternal. Therefore we stated that of the five items (\u003cem\u003eīśvara, jīva, prakṛti,\u003c/em\u003e time and \u003cem\u003ekarma\u003c/em\u003e) four are eternal, whereas \u003cem\u003ekarma\u003c/em\u003e is not eternal.33:T7df,The supreme conscious \u003cem\u003eīśvara\u003c/em\u003e is similar to the living entity in this way: both the consciousness of the Lord and that of the living entity are transcendental.

The theory that consciousness develops under certain circumstances of material combination is not accepted in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā.\u003c/em\u003e Consciousness may be pervertedly reflected by the covering of material circumstances, just as light reflect"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"ed through colored glass may appear to be a certain color, but the consciousness of the Lord is not materially affected.

So the Lord is not materially contaminated. Our consciousness, at the present moment, however, \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e materially contaminated. The \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e teaches that we have to purify this materially contaminated consciousness. In pure consciousness, our actions will be dovetailed to the will of the \u003cem\u003eīśvara,\u003c/em\u003e and that will make us happy. It is not that we have to cease all activities.

An ignorant person may see that a devotee is acting or working like an ordinary man, but such a person with a poor fund of knowledge does not know that the activities of the devotee or of the Lord are not contaminated by impure consciousness or matter. They are transcendental to the three modes of nature. We should know, however, that at this point our consciousness is contaminated.34:T6b5,When we are materially contaminated, we are called conditioned.

One who wants to become free, who wants to become liberated, must first of all learn that he is not this material body. \u003cem\u003eMukti,\u003c/em\u003e or liberation, means freedom from material consciousness. In the \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\u003c/em\u003e also the definition of liberation is given. \u003cem\u003eMuktir hitvānyathā-rūpaṁ svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ: mukti\u003c/em\u003e means liberation from the contaminated consciousness of this material world and situation in pure consciousness.

Purified consciousness means acting in accordance with the instructions of the Lord. This is the whole sum and substance of purified consciousness. Consciousness is already there because we are part and parcel of the Lord, but for us there is the affinity of being affected by the inferior modes. But the Lord, being the Supreme, is never affected. That is the difference between the Supreme Lord and the small individual souls.35:T8df,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"What is this consciousness? This consciousness is “I am.” Then what am I? In contaminated consciousness “I am” means “I am the lord of all I survey. I am the enjoyer.” The world revolves because every living being thinks that he is the lord and creator of the material world. Material consciousness has two psychic divisions. One is that I am the creator, and the other is that I am the enjoyer. But actually the Supreme Lord is both the creator and the enjoyer, and the living entity, being part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is neither the creator nor the enjoyer, but a cooperator. He is the created and the enjoyed. For instance, a part of a machine cooperates with the whole machine; a part of the body cooperates with the whole body. The hands, legs, eyes and so on are all parts of the body, but they are not actually the enjoyers. The stomach is the enjoyer. The legs move, the hands supply food, the teeth chew, and all parts of the body are engaged in satisfying the stomach because the stomach is the principal factor that nourishes the body’s organization. Therefore everything is given to the stomach. One nourishes the tree by watering its root, and one nourishes the body by feeding the stomach, for if the body is to be kept in a healthy state, then the parts of the body must cooperate to feed the stomach. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the enjoyer and the creator, and we, as subordinate living beings, are meant to cooperate to satisfy Him. This cooperation will actually help us, just as food taken by the stomach will help all other parts of the body. If the fingers of the hand think that they should take the food themselves instead of giving it to the stomach, then they will be frustrated. The central figure of creation and of enjoyment is the Supreme Lord, and the living entities are cooperators. By cooperation they enjoy. The relation is also like that of the master and the servant. If the master is fully satisfied, then the servant is satisfied. Similarly, the Supreme Lord should be satisfied, although the tendency to become the creator and the tendency to enjoy the material world are there also in the living entities because these tendencies are there in the Supreme Lord who has created the manifested cosmic world."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"36:T591,It is also explained in the \u003cem\u003eGītā\u003c/em\u003e that impersonal Brahman is also subordinate to the complete Supreme Person (\u003cem\u003ebrahmaṇo hi pratiṣṭhāham\u003c/em\u003e). Brahman is more explicitly explained in the \u003cem\u003eBrahma-sūtra\u003c/em\u003e to be like the rays of the sunshine. The impersonal Brahman is the shining rays of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Impersonal Brahman is incomplete realization of the absolute whole, and so also is the conception of Paramātmā. In the Fifteenth Chapter it shall be seen that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Puruṣottama, is above both impersonal Brahman and the partial realization of Paramātmā. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is called \u003cem\u003esac-cid-ānanda-vigraha.\u003c/em\u003e The \u003cem\u003eBrahma-saṁhitā\u003c/em\u003e begins in this way: \u003cem\u003eīśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ/ anādir ādir govindaḥ sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam.\u003c/em\u003e “Govinda, Kṛṣṇa, is the cause of all causes. He is the primal cause, and He is the very form of eternity, knowledge and bliss.” Impersonal Brahman realization is the realization of His \u003cem\u003esat\u003c/em\u003e (eternity) feature. Paramātmā realization is the realization of \u003cem\u003esat-cit\u003c/em\u003e (eternal knowledge). But realization of the Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, is realization of all the transcendental features: \u003cem\u003esat, cit\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eānanda\u003c/em\u003e (eternity, knowledge and bliss) in complete \u003cem\u003evigraha\u003c/em\u003e (form).37:T454,The complete whole, the Personality of Godhead, has immense potencies (\u003cem\u003eparāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate\u003c/em\u003e). How Kṛṣṇa is acting in different potencies is also explained in \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā.\u003c/em\u003e This phenomenal world or material world in which we are placed is also complete in itself because the twenty-four elements of which this material universe is a temporary manifestation, according to Sāṅkhya philosophy, are completely adjusted to produce complete resources which are necessary for the maintenance and subsistence of this universe. There is nothing extraneous, nor is there "])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"anything needed. This manifestation has its own time fixed by the energy of the supreme whole, and when its time is complete, these temporary manifestations will be annihilated by the complete arrangement of the complete. There is complete facility for the small complete units, namely the living entities, to realize the complete, and all sorts of incompleteness are experienced due to incomplete knowledge of the complete. So \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e contains the complete knowledge of Vedic wisdom.38:T5b1,Vedic knowledge is not a question of research. Our research work is imperfect because we are researching things with imperfect senses.

We have to receive knowledge from the proper source in disciplic succession beginning with the supreme spiritual master, the Lord Himself, and handed down to a succession of spiritual masters. Arjuna, the student who took lessons from Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, accepts everything that He says without contradicting Him. One is not allowed to accept one portion of \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e and not another. No. We must accept \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e without interpretation, without deletion and without our own whimsical participation in the matter. The \u003cem\u003eGītā\u003c/em\u003e should be taken as the most perfect presentation of Vedic knowledge. Vedic knowledge is received from transcendental sources, and the first words were spoken by the Lord Himself. The words spoken by the Lord are called \u003cem\u003eapauruṣeya,\u003c/em\u003e meaning that they are different from words spoken by a person of the mundane world who is infected with four defects. A mundaner (1) is sure to commit mistakes, (2) is invariably illusioned, (3) has the tendency to cheat others and (4) is limited by imperfect senses. With these four imperfections, one cannot deliver perfect information of all-pervading knowledge.39:T477,In this world men are not meant for quarreling like cats and dogs.

Animals can kill other living animals, and there is no question of sin on their part, but if a man kills an animal for the satisfaction of his uncontrolled taste, he must be responsible for breaking the laws of nature. In the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e it is clearly explained that there are three kinds of activities according to the different modes of nature: the activities of goodness, of passion and of ignorance. Similarly, there are three kinds of eatables also: eatables in goodness, passion and ignorance. All of this is clearly described, and if we properly utilize the instructions of \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā,\u003c/em\u003e then our whole life will become purified, and ultimately we will be able to reach the destination which is beyond this material sky.3a:T555,That destination is called the \u003cem\u003esanātana\u003c/em\u003e sky, the eternal, spiritual sky (\u003cem\u003eyad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama\u003c/em\u003e).

We are temporarily engaged in different activities, but all of these activities can be purified when we give up all these temporary activities and take up the activities which are prescribed by the Supreme Lord. That is called our pure life.3b:T4ba,The English word \u003cem\u003ereligion\u003c/em\u003e is a little different from \u003cem\u003esanātana-dharma. Religion\u003c/em\u003e conveys the idea of faith, and faith may change. One may have faith in a particular process, and he may change this faith and adopt another, but \u003cem\u003esanātana-dharma\u003c/em\u003e refers to that activity which cannot be changed. For instance, liquidity cannot be taken from water, nor can heat be taken from fire. Similarly, the eternal function of the eternal living entity cannot be taken from the living entity. \u003cem\u003eSanātana-dharma\u003c/em\u003e is eternally integral with the living entity. When we speak of \u003cem\u003esanātana-dharma,\u003c/em\u003e therefore, we must take it for granted on the authority of Śrīpāda Rāmānujācārya that it has neither beginning nor end. That which has neither end nor beginning must not be sectarian, for it cannot be limited by any boundaries. Those belonging to some sectarian faith will wrongly consider that \u003cem\u003esanātana-dharma\u003c/em\u003e is also sectarian, but if we go deeply into the matter and consider it in the light of modern science, it is possible for us to see that \u003cem\u003esanātana-dharma\u003c/em\u003e is the business of all the people of the world – nay, of all the living entities of the universe.3c:T471,Non-\u003cem\u003esanātana\u003c/em\u003e religious faith may have some beginning in the annals of human history, but there is no beginning to the history of \u003cem\u003esanātana-dharma,\u003c/em\u003e because it remains eternally with the living entities.

In reference to the concept of \u003cem\u003esanātana-dharma,\u003c/em\u003e we must try to understand the concept of religion from the Sanskrit root meaning of the word. \u003cem\u003eDharma\u003c/em\u003e refers to that which is constantly existing with a particular object. We conclude that there is heat and light along with the fire; without heat and light, there is no meaning to the word fire. Similarly, we must discover the essential part of the living being, that part which is his constant companion. That constant companion is his eternal quality, and that eternal quality is his eternal religion.3d:T69e,When Sanātana Gosvāmī asked Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu about the \u003cem\u003esvarūpa\u003c/em\u003e of every living being, the Lord replied that the \u003cem\u003esvarūpa,\u003c/em\u003e or constitutional position, of the living being is the rendering of service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If we analyze this statement of Lord Caitanya’s, we can easily see that every living being is constantly engaged in rendering service to another living being. A living being serves other living beings in various capacities. By doing so, the living entity enjoys life. The lower animals serve human beings as servants serve their master. A serves B master, B serves C master, and C serves D master and so on. Under these circumstances, we can see that one friend serves another friend, the mother serves the son, the wife serves the husband, the husband serves the wife and so on. If we go on searching in this spirit, it will be seen that there is no exception in the society of living beings to the activity of service. The politician presents his manifesto for the public to convince them of his capacity for service. The voters therefore give the politician their valuable votes, thinking that he will render valuable service to society. The shopkeeper serves the customer, and the artisan serves the capitalist.

In this way we can see that no living being is exempt from rendering service to other living beings, and therefore we can safely conclude that service is the constant companion of the living being and that the rendering of service is the eternal religion of the living being.3e:T591,This verse gives a description of that eternal sky. Of course we have a material conception of the sky, and we think of it in relationship to the sun, moon, stars and so on, but in this verse the Lord states that in the eternal sky there is no need for the sun nor for the moon nor electricity or fire of any kind because the spiritual sky is already illuminated by the \u003cem\u003ebrahma-jyotir,\u003c/em\u003e the rays emanating from the Supreme Lord. We are trying with difficulty to reach other planets, but it is not difficult to understand the abode of the Supreme Lord. This abode is referred to as Goloka. In the \u003cem\u003eBrahma-saṁhitā\u003c/em\u003e (5.37) it is beautifully described: \u003cem\u003egoloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūtaḥ.\u003c/em\u003e The Lord resides eternally in His abode Goloka, yet He can be approached from this world, and to this end the Lord comes to manifest His real form, \u003cem\u003esac-cid-ānanda-vigraha.\u003c/em\u003e When He manifests this form, there is no need for our imagining what He looks like. To discourage such imaginative speculation, He descends and exhibits Himself as He is, as Śyāmasundara. Unfortunately, the less intelligent deride Him because He comes as one of us and plays with us as a human being. But because of this we should not consider the Lord one of us. It is by His omnipotency that He presents Himself in His real form before us and displays His pastimes, which are replicas of those pastimes found in His abode.3f:T51b,That \u003cem\u003epadam avyayam,\u003c/em\u003e or eternal kingdom, can be reached by one who is \u003cem\u003enirmāna-moha.\u003c/em\u003e What does this mean? We are after designations.

As long as we are attached to these designations, we are attached to the body, because designations belong to the body. But we are not these bodies, and realizing this is the first stage in spiritual realization. We are associated with the three modes of material nature, but we must become detached through devotional service to the Lord. If we are not attached to devotional service to the Lord, then we cannot become detached from the modes of material nature. Designations and attachments are due to our lust and desire, our wanting to lord it over the material nature. As long as we do not give up this propensity of lording it over material nature, there is no possibility of returning to the kingdom of the Supreme, the \u003cem\u003esanātana-dhāma.\u003c/em\u003e That eternal kingdom, which is never destroyed, can be approached by one who is not bewildered by the attractions of false material enjoyments, who is situated in the service of the Supreme Lord. One so situated can easily approach that supreme abode.40:T4d5,“And whoever, at the end of his life, quits his body remembering Me alone at once attains My nature. Of this there is no doubt.” (\u003ca href=\"/en/library/bg/8/5/\"\u003eBg. 8.5\u003c/a\u003e) One who thinks of Kṛṣṇa at the time of his death goes to Kṛṣṇa.

The Supreme Being is \u003cem\u003esac-cid-ānanda-vigraha\u003c/em\u003e – that is, His form is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. Our present body is not \u003cem\u003esac-cid-ānanda.\u003c/em\u003e It is \u003cem\u003easat,\u003c/em\u003e not \u003cem\u003esat.\u003c/em\u003e It is not eternal; it is perishable.

All of the miseries we experience in the material world arise from the body, but one who leaves this body thinking of Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, at once attains a \u003cem\u003esac-cid-ānanda\u003c/em\u003e body.41:T7e9,As explained before, there are different kinds of transcendentalists – the \u003cem\u003ebrahma-vādī, paramātma-vādī\u003c/em\u003e and the devotee – and, as mentioned, in the \u003cem\u003ebrahma-jyotir\u003c/em\u003e (spiritual sky) there are innumerable spiritual planets. The number of these planets is far, far greater than all of the planets of this material world. This material world has been approximated as only one quarter of the creation (\u003cem\u003eekāṁśena sthito jagat\u003c/em\u003e). In this material segment there are millions and billions of universes with trillions of planets and suns, stars and moons. But this whole material creation is only a fragment of the total creation. Most of the creation is in the spiritual sky. One who desires to merge into the existence of the Supreme Brahman is at once transferred to the \u003cem\u003ebrahma-jyotir\u003c/em\u003e of the Supreme Lord and thus attains the spiritual sky. The devotee, who wants to enjoy the association of the Lord, enters into the Vaikuṇṭha planets, which are innumerable, and the Supreme Lord by His plenary expansions as Nārāyaṇa with four hands and with different names like Pradyumna, Aniruddha and Govinda associates with him there. Therefore at the end of life the transcendentalists think either of the \u003cem\u003ebrahma-jyotir,\u003c/em\u003e the Paramātmā or the Supreme Personality of Godhead Śrī Kṛṣṇa. In all cases they enter into the spiritual sky, but only the devotee, or he who is in personal touch with the Supreme Lord, enters into the Vaikuṇṭha planets or the Goloka Vṛndāvana planet. The Lord further adds that of this “there is no doubt.” This must be believed firmly. We should not reject that which does not tally with our imagination; our attitude should be that of Arjuna: “I believe everything that You have said.” "])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Therefore when the Lord says that at the time of death whoever thinks of Him as Brahman or Paramātmā or as the Personality of Godhead certainly enters into the spiritual sky, there is no doubt about it. There is no question of disbelieving it.42:T4ad,The forgetful living entities or conditioned souls have forgotten their relationship with the Supreme Lord, and they are engrossed in thinking of material activities. Just to transfer their thinking power to the spiritual sky, Kṛṣṇa-dvaipāyana Vyāsa has given a great number of Vedic literatures. First he divided the \u003cem\u003eVedas\u003c/em\u003e into four, then he explained them in the \u003cem\u003ePurāṇas,\u003c/em\u003e and for less capable people he wrote the \u003cem\u003eMahābhārata.\u003c/em\u003e In the \u003cem\u003eMahābhārata\u003c/em\u003e there is given the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā.\u003c/em\u003e Then all Vedic literature is summarized in the \u003cem\u003eVedānta-sūtra,\u003c/em\u003e and for future guidance he gave a natural commentation on the \u003cem\u003eVedānta-sūtra,\u003c/em\u003e called \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.\u003c/em\u003e We must always engage our minds in reading these Vedic literatures. Just as materialists engage their minds in reading newspapers, magazines and so many materialistic literatures, we must transfer our reading to these literatures which are given to us by Vyāsadeva; in that way it will be possible for us to remember the Supreme Lord at the time of death. That is the only way suggested by the Lord, and He guarantees the result: “There is no doubt.”43:T757,He does not advise Arjuna simply to remember Him and give up his occupation. No, the Lord never suggests anything impractical. In this material world, in order to maintain the body one has to work. Human society is divided, according to work, into four divisions of social order – \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eśūdra.\u003c/em\u003e The \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa\u003c/em\u003e class or intelligent class is working in one way, the \u003cem\u003ekṣatriya\u003c/em\u003e or administrative class is working in another way, and the mercantile class and the laborers are all tending to their specific duties. In the hu"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"man society, whether one is a laborer, merchant, administrator or farmer, or even if one belongs to the highest class and is a literary man, a scientist or a theologian, he has to work in order to maintain his existence. The Lord therefore tells Arjuna that he need not give up his occupation, but while he is engaged in his occupation he should remember Kṛṣṇa (\u003cem\u003emām anusmara\u003c/em\u003e). If he doesn’t practice remembering Kṛṣṇa while he is struggling for existence, then it will not be possible for him to remember Kṛṣṇa at the time of death. Lord Caitanya also advises this. He says, \u003cem\u003ekīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ:\u003c/em\u003e one should practice chanting the names of the Lord always. The names of the Lord and the Lord are nondifferent. So Lord Kṛṣṇa’s instructions to Arjuna to “remember Me” and Lord Caitanya’s injunction to “always chant the names of Lord Kṛṣṇa” are the same instruction. There is no difference, because Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa’s name are nondifferent. In the absolute status there is no difference between reference and referrent. Therefore we have to practice remembering the Lord always, twenty-four hours a day, by chanting His names and molding our life’s activities in such a way that we can remember Him always.44:T4e0,How is this possible? The \u003cem\u003eācāryas\u003c/em\u003e give the following example. If a married woman is attached to another man, or if a man has an attachment for a woman other than his wife, then the attachment is to be considered very strong. One with such an attachment is always thinking of the loved one. The wife who is thinking of her lover is always thinking of meeting him, even while she is carrying out her household chores. In fact, she carries out her household work even more carefully so her husband will not suspect her attachment. Similarly, we should always remember the supreme lover, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and at the same time perform our material duties very nicely. A strong sense of love is required here. If we have a strong sense of love "])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"for the Supreme Lord, then we can discharge our duty and at the same time remember Him. But we have to develop that sense of love. Arjuna, for instance, was always thinking of Kṛṣṇa; he was the constant companion of Kṛṣṇa, and at the same time he was a warrior. Kṛṣṇa did not advise him to give up fighting and go to the forest to meditate. When Lord Kṛṣṇa delineates the \u003cem\u003eyoga\u003c/em\u003e system to Arjuna, Arjuna says that the practice of this system is not possible for him.47:T5e9,He tells Arjuna that He is relating this supreme secret to him because Arjuna is His devotee and His friend. The purport of this is that \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e is a treatise which is especially meant for the devotee of the Lord. There are three classes of transcendentalists, namely the \u003cem\u003ejñānī,\u003c/em\u003e the \u003cem\u003eyogī\u003c/em\u003e and the \u003cem\u003ebhakta,\u003c/em\u003e or the impersonalist, the meditator and the devotee. Here the Lord clearly tells Arjuna that He is making him the first receiver of a new \u003cem\u003eparamparā\u003c/em\u003e (disciplic succession) because the old succession was broken. It was the Lord’s wish, therefore, to establish another \u003cem\u003eparamparā\u003c/em\u003e in the same line of thought that was coming down from the sun-god to others, and it was His wish that His teaching be distributed anew by Arjuna. He wanted Arjuna to become the authority in understanding the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā.\u003c/em\u003e So we see that \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e is instructed to Arjuna especially because Arjuna was a devotee of the Lord, a direct student of Kṛṣṇa, and His intimate friend. Therefore \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e is best understood by a person who has qualities similar to Arjuna’s. That is to say he must be a devotee in a direct relationship with the Lord. As soon as one becomes a devotee of the Lord, he also has a direct relationship with the Lord. That is a very elaborate subject matter, but briefly it can be stated that a devotee is in a relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in one of five different ways:48:T4c2,The subject of the \u003cem"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e entails the comprehension of five basic truths.

If a living entity says that he is not controlled but that he is free, then he is insane. The living being is controlled in every respect, at least in his conditioned life. So in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e the subject matter deals with the \u003cem\u003eīśvara,\u003c/em\u003e the supreme controller, and the \u003cem\u003ejīvas,\u003c/em\u003e the controlled living entities. \u003cem\u003ePrakṛti\u003c/em\u003e (material nature) and time (the duration of existence of the whole universe or the manifestation of material nature) and \u003cem\u003ekarma\u003c/em\u003e (activity) are also discussed. The cosmic manifestation is full of different activities. All living entities are engaged in different activities. From \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e we must learn what God is, what the living entities are, what \u003cem\u003eprakṛti\u003c/em\u003e is, what the cosmic manifestation is, how it is controlled by time, and what the activities of the living entities are.49:T859,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Out of these five basic subject matters in \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e it is established that the Supreme Godhead, or Kṛṣṇa, or Brahman, or the supreme controller, or Paramātmā – you may use whatever name you like – is the greatest of all. The living beings are in quality like the supreme controller. For instance, the Lord has control over the universal affairs of material nature, as will be explained in the later chapters of \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā.\u003c/em\u003e Material nature is not independent. She is acting under the directions of the Supreme Lord. As Lord Kṛṣṇa says, \u003cem\u003emayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram:\u003c/em\u003e “This material nature is working under My direction.” When we see wonderful things happening in the cosmic nature, we should know that behind this cosmic manifestation there is a controller. Nothing could be manifested without being controlled. It is childish not to consider the controller. For instance, a child may think that an automobile is quite wonderful to be able to run without a horse or other animal pulling it, but a sane man knows the nature of the automobile’s engineering arrangement. He always knows that behind the machinery there is a man, a driver. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the driver under whose direction everything is working. Now the \u003cem\u003ejīvas,\u003c/em\u003e or the living entities, have been accepted by the Lord, as we will note in the later chapters, as His parts and parcels. A particle of gold is also gold, a drop of water from the ocean is also salty, and similarly we the living entities, being part and parcel of the supreme controller, \u003cem\u003eīśvara,\u003c/em\u003e or Bhagavān, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, have all the qualities of the Supreme Lord in minute quantity because we are minute \u003cem\u003eīśvaras,\u003c/em\u003e subordinate \u003cem\u003eīśvaras.\u003c/em\u003e We are trying to control nature, as presently we are trying to control space or planets, and this tendency to control is there because it is in Kṛṣṇa.

The manifestation of \u003cem\u003eprakṛti\u003c/em\u003e may be temporary, but it is not false. Some philosophers say that the manifestation of material nature is false, but according to the philosophy of \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e or according to the philosophy of the Vaiṣṇavas, this is not so. The manifestation of the world is not accepted as false; it is accepted as real, but temporary. It is likened unto a cloud which moves across the sky, or the coming of the rainy season, which nourishes grains. As soon as the rainy season is over and as soon as the cloud goes away, all the crops which were nourished by the rain dry up. Similarly, this material manifestation takes place at a certain interval, stays for a while and then disappears. Such are the workings of \u003cem\u003eprakṛti.\u003c/em\u003e But this cycle is working eternally. Therefore \u003cem\u003eprakṛti\u003c/em\u003e is eternal; it is not false. The Lord refers to this as “My \u003cem\u003eprakṛti.\u003c/em\u003e” This material nature is the separated energy of the Supreme Lord, and similarly the living entities are also the energy of the Supreme Lord, although they are not separated but eternally related. So the Lord, the living entity, material nature and time are all interrelated and are all eternal. However, the other item, \u003cem\u003ekarma,\u003c/em\u003e is not eternal.

We are engaged in various activities. Undoubtedly we do not know what sort of activities we should adopt to gain relief from the actions and reactions of all these activities, but this is also explained in the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā.\u003c/em\u003e"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"4b:T5ee,The distinction between the \u003cem\u003ejīva\u003c/em\u003e and the \u003cem\u003eīśvara\u003c/em\u003e will be explained in the Thirteenth Chapter of \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā.\u003c/em\u003e The Lord is \u003cem\u003ekṣetra-jña,\u003c/em\u003e conscious, as is the living being, but the living being is conscious of his particular body, whereas the Lord is conscious of all bodies.

It is also explained that the Paramātmā, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is living in everyone’s heart as \u003cem\u003eīśvara,\u003c/em\u003e as the controller, and that He is giving directions for the living entity to act as he desires.

As the soul thus migrates, he suffers the actions and reactions of his past activities. These activities can be changed when the living being is in the mode of goodness, in sanity, and understands what sort of activities he should adopt. If he does so, then all the actions and reactions of his past activities can be changed. Consequently, \u003cem\u003ekarma\u003c/em\u003e is not eternal.

This consciousness is “I am.” Then what am I? In contaminated consciousness “I am” means “I am the lord of all I survey.

One is that I am the creator, and the other is that I am the enjoyer. But actually the Supreme Lord is both the creator and the enjoyer, and the living entity, being part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is neither the creator nor the enjoyer, but a cooperator. He is the created and the enjoyed. For instance, a part of a machine cooperates with the whole machine; a part of the body cooperates with the whole body. The hands, legs, eyes and so on are all parts of the body, but they are not actually the enjoyers. The stomach is the enjoyer. The legs move, the hands supply food, the teeth chew, and all parts of the body are engaged in satisfying the stomach because the stomach is the principal factor that nourishes the body’s organization. Therefore everything is given to the stomach. One nourishes the tree by watering its root, and one nourishes the body by feeding the stomach, for if the body is to be kept in a healthy state, then the parts of the body must cooperate to feed the stomach. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the enjoyer and the creator, and we, as subordinate living beings, are meant to cooperate to satisfy Him. This cooperation will actually help us, just as food taken by the stomach will help all other parts of the body. If the fingers of the hand think that they should take the food themselves instead of giving it to the stomach, then they will be frustrated. The central figure of creation and of enjoyment is the Supreme Lord, and the living entities are cooperators. By cooperation they enjoy. The relation is also like that of the master and the servant. If the master is fully satisfied, then the servant is satisfied. Similarly, the Supreme Lord should be satisfied, although the tendency to become the creator and the tendency to enjoy the material world are there also in the living entities because these tendencies are there in the Supreme Lord who has created the manifested cosmic world."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"4f:T591,It is also explained in the \u003cem\u003eGītā\u003c/em\u003e that impersonal Brahman is also subordinate to the complete Supreme Person (\u003cem\u003ebrahmaṇo hi pratiṣṭhāham\u003c/em\u003e). Brahman is more explicitly explained in the \u003cem\u003eBrahma-sūtra\u003c/em\u003e to be like the rays of the sunshine. The impersonal Brahman is the shining rays of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Impersonal Brahman is incomplete realization of the absolute whole, and so also is the conception of Paramātmā. In the Fifteenth Chapter it shall be seen that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Puruṣottama, is above both impersonal Brahman and the partial realization of Paramātmā. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is called \u003cem\u003esac-cid-ānanda-vigraha.\u003c/em\u003e The \u003cem\u003eBrahma-saṁhitā\u003c/em\u003e begins in this way: \u003cem\u003eīśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ/ anādir ādir govindaḥ sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam.\u003c/em\u003e “Govinda, Kṛṣṇa, is the cause of all causes. He is the primal cause, and He is the very form of eternity, knowledge and bliss.” Impersonal Brahman realization is the realization of His \u003cem\u003esat\u003c/em\u003e (eternity) feature. Paramātmā realization is the realization of \u003cem\u003esat-cit\u003c/em\u003e (eternal knowledge). But realization of the Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, is realization of all the transcendental features: \u003cem\u003esat, cit\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eānanda\u003c/em\u003e (eternity, knowledge and bliss) in complete \u003cem\u003evigraha\u003c/em\u003e (form).50:T454,The complete whole, the Personality of Godhead, has immense potencies (\u003cem\u003eparāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate\u003c/em\u003e). How Kṛṣṇa is acting in different potencies is also explained in \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā.\u003c/em\u003e This phenomenal world or material world in which we are placed is also complete in itself because the twenty-four elements of which this material universe is a temporary manifestation, according to Sāṅkhya philosophy, are completely adjusted to produce complete resources which are necessary for the maintenance and subsistence of this universe. There is nothing extraneous, nor is there "])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"anything needed. This manifestation has its own time fixed by the energy of the supreme whole, and when its time is complete, these temporary manifestations will be annihilated by the complete arrangement of the complete. There is complete facility for the small complete units, namely the living entities, to realize the complete, and all sorts of incompleteness are experienced due to incomplete knowledge of the complete. So \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e contains the complete knowledge of Vedic wisdom.51:T5b1,Vedic knowledge is not a question of research. Our research work is imperfect because we are researching things with imperfect senses. We have to accept perfect knowledge which comes down, as is stated in \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā,\u003c/em\u003e by the \u003cem\u003eparamparā\u003c/em\u003e (disciplic succession). We have to receive knowledge from the proper source in disciplic succession beginning with the supreme spiritual master, the Lord Himself, and handed down to a succession of spiritual masters. Arjuna, the student who took lessons from Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, accepts everything that He says without contradicting Him. One is not allowed to accept one portion of \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e and not another. No. We must accept \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e without interpretation, without deletion and without our own whimsical participation in the matter. The \u003cem\u003eGītā\u003c/em\u003e should be taken as the most perfect presentation of Vedic knowledge. Vedic knowledge is received from transcendental sources, and the first words were spoken by the Lord Himself. The words spoken by the Lord are called \u003cem\u003eapauruṣeya,\u003c/em\u003e meaning that they are different from words spoken by a person of the mundane world who is infected with four defects. A mundaner (1) is sure to commit mistakes, (2) is invariably illusioned, (3) has the tendency to cheat others and (4) is limited by imperfect senses. With these four imperfections, one cannot deliver perfect information of all-pervading knowledge.52:T477,In this world men are not meant for quarreling like cats and dogs.

A human being should realize the aim of his life, and this direction is given in all Vedic literatures, and the essence is given in \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā.\u003c/em\u003e Vedic literature is meant for human beings, not for animals. Animals can kill other living animals, and there is no question of sin on their part, but if a man kills an animal for the satisfaction of his uncontrolled taste, he must be responsible for breaking the laws of nature. In the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e it is clearly explained that there are three kinds of activities according to the different modes of nature: the activities of goodness, of passion and of ignorance. Similarly, there are three kinds of eatables also: eatables in goodness, passion and ignorance. All of this is clearly described, and if we properly utilize the instructions of \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā,\u003c/em\u003e then our whole life will become purified, and ultimately we will be able to reach the destination which is beyond this material sky.53:T555,That destination is called the \u003cem\u003esanātana\u003c/em\u003e sky, the eternal, spiritual sky (\u003cem\u003eyad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama\u003c/em\u003e). In this material world we find that everything is temporary. It comes into being, stays for some time, produces some by-products, dwindles and then vanishes. That is the law of the material world, whether we use as an example this body, or a piece of fruit or anything. But beyond this temporary world there is another world of which we have information. That world consists of another nature, which is \u003cem\u003esanātana,\u003c/em\u003e eternal. The \u003cem\u003ejīva\u003c/em\u003e is also described as \u003cem\u003esanātana,\u003c/em\u003e eternal, and the Lord is also described as \u003cem\u003esanātana\u003c/em\u003e in the Eleventh Chapter. We have an intimate relationship with the Lord, and because we are all qualitatively one – the \u003cem\u003esanātana-dhāma,\u003c/em\u003e or sky, the \u003cem\u003esanātana\u003c/em\u003e Supreme Personality and the \u003cem\u003esanātana\u003c/em\u003e living entities – the whole purpose of \u003cem\u003e"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Bhagavad-gītā\u003c/em\u003e is to revive our \u003cem\u003esanātana\u003c/em\u003e occupation, or \u003cem\u003esanātana-dharma,\u003c/em\u003e which is the eternal occupation of the living entity. We are temporarily engaged in different activities, but all of these activities can be purified when we give up all these temporary activities and take up the activities which are prescribed by the Supreme Lord. That is called our pure life.54:T4ba,The English word \u003cem\u003ereligion\u003c/em\u003e is a little different from \u003cem\u003esanātana-dharma. Religion\u003c/em\u003e conveys the idea of faith, and faith may change. One may have faith in a particular process, and he may change this faith and adopt another, but \u003cem\u003esanātana-dharma\u003c/em\u003e refers to that activity which cannot be changed. For instance, liquidity cannot be taken from water, nor can heat be taken from fire. Similarly, the eternal function of the eternal living entity cannot be taken from the living entity. \u003cem\u003eSanātana-dharma\u003c/em\u003e is eternally integral with the living entity. When we speak of \u003cem\u003esanātana-dharma,\u003c/em\u003e therefore, we must take it for granted on the authority of Śrīpāda Rāmānujācārya that it has neither beginning nor end. That which has neither end nor beginning must not be sectarian, for it cannot be limited by any boundaries. Those belonging to some sectarian faith will wrongly consider that \u003cem\u003esanātana-dharma\u003c/em\u003e is also sectarian, but if we go deeply into the matter and consider it in the light of modern science, it is possible for us to see that \u003cem\u003esanātana-dharma\u003c/em\u003e is the business of all the people of the world – nay, of all the living entities of the universe.55:T471,Non-\u003cem\u003esanātana\u003c/em\u003e religious faith may have some beginning in the annals of human history, but there is no beginning to the history of \u003cem\u003esanātana-dharma,\u003c/em\u003e because it remains eternally with the living entities. Insofar as the living entities are concerned, the authoritative \u003cem\u003eśāstras\u003c/em\u003e state that the living entity has neither birth nor death. In the \u003cem\u003eGītā\u003c/em\u003e it is stated that the living entity is neve"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"r born and he never dies. He is eternal and indestructible, and he continues to live after the destruction of his temporary material body. In reference to the concept of \u003cem\u003esanātana-dharma,\u003c/em\u003e we must try to understand the concept of religion from the Sanskrit root meaning of the word. \u003cem\u003eDharma\u003c/em\u003e refers to that which is constantly existing with a particular object. We conclude that there is heat and light along with the fire; without heat and light, there is no meaning to the word fire. Similarly, we must discover the essential part of the living being, that part which is his constant companion. That constant companion is his eternal quality, and that eternal quality is his eternal religion.56:T69e,When Sanātana Gosvāmī asked Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu about the \u003cem\u003esvarūpa\u003c/em\u003e of every living being, the Lord replied that the \u003cem\u003esvarūpa,\u003c/em\u003e or constitutional position, of the living being is the rendering of service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If we analyze this statement of Lord Caitanya’s, we can easily see that every living being is constantly engaged in rendering service to another living being. A living being serves other living beings in various capacities. By doing so, the living entity enjoys life. The lower animals serve human beings as servants serve their master. A serves B master, B serves C master, and C serves D master and so on. Under these circumstances, we can see that one friend serves another friend, the mother serves the son, the wife serves the husband, the husband serves the wife and so on. If we go on searching in this spirit, it will be seen that there is no exception in the society of living beings to the activity of service. The politician presents his manifesto for the public to convince them of his capacity for service. The voters therefore give the politician their valuable votes, thinking that he will render valuable service to society. The shopkeeper serves the customer, and the artisan serves the capitalist. The capitalist serves the family, and the fa"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"mily serves the state in the terms of the eternal capacity of the eternal living being. In this way we can see that no living being is exempt from rendering service to other living beings, and therefore we can safely conclude that service is the constant companion of the living being and that the rendering of service is the eternal religion of the living being.57:T591,This verse gives a description of that eternal sky. Of course we have a material conception of the sky, and we think of it in relationship to the sun, moon, stars and so on, but in this verse the Lord states that in the eternal sky there is no need for the sun nor for the moon nor electricity or fire of any kind because the spiritual sky is already illuminated by the \u003cem\u003ebrahma-jyotir,\u003c/em\u003e the rays emanating from the Supreme Lord. We are trying with difficulty to reach other planets, but it is not difficult to understand the abode of the Supreme Lord. This abode is referred to as Goloka. In the \u003cem\u003eBrahma-saṁhitā\u003c/em\u003e (5.37) it is beautifully described: \u003cem\u003egoloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūtaḥ.\u003c/em\u003e The Lord resides eternally in His abode Goloka, yet He can be approached from this world, and to this end the Lord comes to manifest His real form, \u003cem\u003esac-cid-ānanda-vigraha.\u003c/em\u003e When He manifests this form, there is no need for our imagining what He looks like. To discourage such imaginative speculation, He descends and exhibits Himself as He is, as Śyāmasundara. Unfortunately, the less intelligent deride Him because He comes as one of us and plays with us as a human being. But because of this we should not consider the Lord one of us. It is by His omnipotency that He presents Himself in His real form before us and displays His pastimes, which are replicas of those pastimes found in His abode.58:T51b,That \u003cem\u003epadam avyayam,\u003c/em\u003e or eternal kingdom, can be reached by one who is \u003cem\u003enirmāna-moha.\u003c/em\u003e What does this mean? We are after designations. Someone wants to become “sir,” someone wants to become “lord,” someone wants to become"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1," the president or a rich man or a king or something else. As long as we are attached to these designations, we are attached to the body, because designations belong to the body. But we are not these bodies, and realizing this is the first stage in spiritual realization. We are associated with the three modes of material nature, but we must become detached through devotional service to the Lord. If we are not attached to devotional service to the Lord, then we cannot become detached from the modes of material nature. Designations and attachments are due to our lust and desire, our wanting to lord it over the material nature. As long as we do not give up this propensity of lording it over material nature, there is no possibility of returning to the kingdom of the Supreme, the \u003cem\u003esanātana-dhāma.\u003c/em\u003e That eternal kingdom, which is never destroyed, can be approached by one who is not bewildered by the attractions of false material enjoyments, who is situated in the service of the Supreme Lord. One so situated can easily approach that supreme abode.59:T7e9,As explained before, there are different kinds of transcendentalists – the \u003cem\u003ebrahma-vādī, paramātma-vādī\u003c/em\u003e and the devotee – and, as mentioned, in the \u003cem\u003ebrahma-jyotir\u003c/em\u003e (spiritual sky) there are innumerable spiritual planets. The number of these planets is far, far greater than all of the planets of this material world. This material world has been approximated as only one quarter of the creation (\u003cem\u003eekāṁśena sthito jagat\u003c/em\u003e). In this material segment there are millions and billions of universes with trillions of planets and suns, stars and moons. But this whole material creation is only a fragment of the total creation. Most of the creation is in the spiritual sky. One who desires to merge into the existence of the Supreme Brahman is at once transferred to the \u003cem\u003ebrahma-jyotir\u003c/em\u003e of the Supreme Lord and thus attains the spiritual sky. The devotee, who wants to enjoy the association of the Lord, enters into the Vaikuṇṭha planets, "])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"which are innumerable, and the Supreme Lord by His plenary expansions as Nārāyaṇa with four hands and with different names like Pradyumna, Aniruddha and Govinda associates with him there. Therefore at the end of life the transcendentalists think either of the \u003cem\u003ebrahma-jyotir,\u003c/em\u003e the Paramātmā or the Supreme Personality of Godhead Śrī Kṛṣṇa. In all cases they enter into the spiritual sky, but only the devotee, or he who is in personal touch with the Supreme Lord, enters into the Vaikuṇṭha planets or the Goloka Vṛndāvana planet. The Lord further adds that of this “there is no doubt.” This must be believed firmly. We should not reject that which does not tally with our imagination; our attitude should be that of Arjuna: “I believe everything that You have said.” Therefore when the Lord says that at the time of death whoever thinks of Him as Brahman or Paramātmā or as the Personality of Godhead certainly enters into the spiritual sky, there is no doubt about it. There is no question of disbelieving it.5a:T4ad,The forgetful living entities or conditioned souls have forgotten their relationship with the Supreme Lord, and they are engrossed in thinking of material activities. Just to transfer their thinking power to the spiritual sky, Kṛṣṇa-dvaipāyana Vyāsa has given a great number of Vedic literatures. First he divided the \u003cem\u003eVedas\u003c/em\u003e into four, then he explained them in the \u003cem\u003ePurāṇas,\u003c/em\u003e and for less capable people he wrote the \u003cem\u003eMahābhārata.\u003c/em\u003e In the \u003cem\u003eMahābhārata\u003c/em\u003e there is given the \u003cem\u003eBhagavad-gītā.\u003c/em\u003e Then all Vedic literature is summarized in the \u003cem\u003eVedānta-sūtra,\u003c/em\u003e and for future guidance he gave a natural commentation on the \u003cem\u003eVedānta-sūtra,\u003c/em\u003e called \u003cem\u003eŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.\u003c/em\u003e We must always engage our minds in reading these Vedic literatures.

That is the only way suggested by the Lord, and He guarantees the result: “There is no doubt.”5b:T757,He does not advise Arjuna simply to remember Him and give up his occupation. No, the Lord never suggests anything impractical. In this material world, in order to maintain the body one has to work. Human society is divided, according to work, into four divisions of social order – \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eśūdra.\u003c/em\u003e The \u003cem\u003ebrāhmaṇa\u003c/em\u003e class or intelligent class is working in one way, the \u003cem\u003ekṣatriya\u003c/em\u003e or administrative class is working in another way, and the mercantile class and the laborers are all tending to their specific duties. In the human society, whether one is a laborer, merchant, administrator or farmer, or even if one belongs to the highest class and is a literary man, a scientist or a theologian, he has to work in order to maintain his existence. The Lord therefore tells Arjuna that he need not give up his occupation, but while he is engaged in his occupation he should remember Kṛṣṇa (\u003cem\u003emām anusmara\u003c/em\u003e). If he doesn’t practice remembering Kṛṣṇa while he is struggling for existence, then it will not be possible for him to remember Kṛṣṇa at the time of death. Lord Caitanya also advises this. He says, \u003cem\u003ekīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ:\u003c/em\u003e one should practice chanting the names of the Lord always. The names of the Lord and the Lord are nondifferent. So Lord Kṛṣṇa’s instructions to Arjuna to “remember Me” and Lord Caitanya’s injunction to “always chant the names of Lord Kṛṣṇa” are the same instruction. There is no difference, because Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa’s name are nondifferent. In the absolute status there is no difference between reference and referrent. Therefore we have to practice remembering the Lord always, twenty-four hours a day, by chanting His names and molding our life’s activities in"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1," such a way that we can remember Him always.5c:T4e0,How is this possible? The \u003cem\u003eācāryas\u003c/em\u003e give the following example. If a married woman is attached to another man, or if a man has an attachment for a woman other than his wife, then the attachment is to be considered very strong. One with such an attachment is always thinking of the loved one. The wife who is thinking of her lover is always thinking of meeting him, even while she is carrying out her household chores. In fact, she carries out her household work even more carefully so her husband will not suspect her attachment. Similarly, we should always remember the supreme lover, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and at the same time perform our material duties very nicely. A strong sense of love is required here. If we have a strong sense of love for the Supreme Lord, then we can discharge our duty and at the same time remember Him. But we have to develop that sense of love. Arjuna, for instance, was always thinking of Kṛṣṇa; he was the constant companion of Kṛṣṇa, and at the same time he was a warrior. Kṛṣṇa did not advise him to give up fighting and go to the forest to meditate. When Lord Kṛṣṇa delineates the \u003cem\u003eyoga\u003c/em\u003e system to Arjuna, Arjuna says that the practice of this system is not possible for him."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"2b:[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"flex flex-col min-h-screen text-vb-normal-text\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"$L21\",null,{\"className\":\"w-full
